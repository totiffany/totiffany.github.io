Summer is here! We're headed to Idaho this weekend for the fourth of July and I can't wait! Both mine and Brian's families live in Idaho, and it will be so fun to see everyone. Bring on the backyards, barbecues, and fireworks! 

Let's celebrate with some delicious smoothies. 

Unfortunately Hazel is terrified of the blender, so I'm not making smoothies as often as I would like. But when Brian is home to cover her ears for a minute we can make it work! 

I have two smoothie recipes I alternate between depending on what I'm in the mood for. The first is a green smoothie that doesn't taste like grass! It took me a while to find a green smoothie that was actually palateable, but I finally discovered the secret ingredient - Frozen mango! Put this in your smoothie and you won't even notice the greens.  

The other one is a pink smoothie that's great for breakfast. Fun fact - One of my first jobs in college was at a Jamba Juice. At the end of a shift you got to bring home a smoothie of your choice, and the one I usually made was really similar to this one. The oats and peanut butter give it a bit more energy than your typical all fruit smoothie. 

Whenever I make a smoothie I tend to throw in some chia seeds. They're nutrient-dense and add a good punch of protein. I buy mine at Trader Joe's but I'm sure they're available at most health food stores. 

Also if you want to get really fancy, you can serve your smoothie in a bowl with toppings because that's a thing now. Sometimes I like to do it because it makes me feel like I'm eating icecream, but up to you!
