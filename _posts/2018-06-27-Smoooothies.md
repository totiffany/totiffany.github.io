Summer is here! 

Let's celebrate with some delicious smoothies. 


Unfortunately Hazel is terrified of the blender, so I'm not making these smoothies as much as I would like. 

I have two smoothie recipes I alternate between depending on what I'm in the mood for. The first is a green smoothie that doesn't taste like grass! It took me a while to find a green smoothie that was actually palateable, but I finally discovered the secret ingredient - Frozen mango! Put this in your smoothie and you won't even notice the greens.  

Whenever I make a smoothie I tend to throw in some chia seeds. They're nutrient-dense and add a good punch of protein. I buy mine at Trader Joe's but I'm sure they're available at most health food stores. 

The pink smoothie is a great one for breakfast. Fun fact - One of my first jobs in college was at a Jamba Juice and this smoothie is based on my favorite one while I worked there. At the end of your shift you got to bring home a smoothie of your choice, and the one I made was really similar to this one. The oats and peanut butter give it a bit more energy than your typical fruit smoothie. 





Green Smoothie
1 cup raw spinach or kale
1 banana
1 cup frozen mango
1 teaspoon chia seeds
1 cup milk

Pink Smoothie
1 cup frozen strawberries
1 banana
