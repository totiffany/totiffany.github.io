Hey there blogging world! It's been a while.

I used to blog pretty regularly a a few years ago, and then I stopped for a variety of reasons – The biggest one being perfectionism. I love to write, but it takes a lot of time for me to feel comfortable pushing "publish" on a blog post. I tend to rewrite and edit over and over again. Blogging about your life and letting yourself be seen takes real courage!

So this time I'm doing my best not to worry about it. I miss writing, and this blog will give me a good excuse to do it more. It'll be simple – I'll write about our lives in the city. What I'm up to. Things I like. I believe in writing a blog you'd want to read yourself, so they'll be a bit of everything from books and beauty to motherhood and city living.

Thanks for being here. Enjoy!
