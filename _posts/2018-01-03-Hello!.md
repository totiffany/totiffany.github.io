Hey there blogging world! It's been awhile.

I used to blog a few years ago, but I stopped for a variety of reasons – The biggest one being perfectionism. I love to write, but it takes a lot of time for me to feel comfortable pushing "publish" on a blog post. I tend to rewrite and edit over and over again. Blogging about your life and letting yourself be seen takes real courage!

So this time I'm doing my best not to worry about it. Let's bring personal blogs back! I miss writing, and this will give me an excuse to do it more. It'll be simple – I'll write about our lives in the city. What I'm up to. Things I like. I believe in writing a blog you'd want to read yourself, so they'll be a bit of everything from books and beauty to motherhood and city living.

Thanks for being here. Enjoy!
