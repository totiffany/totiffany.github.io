My friend Hilary took these photos when Wallace was around three weeks old. We managed to get a couple good shots, but mostly I think they capture the craziness that is our lives right now. We tried bribing Hazel with animal crackers to get her to cooperate, which she has in her mouth in most of the pictures.

Brian just wrapped up his second week at work after paternity leave. So I've been on my own during the day with both kids for a little while now. Overall it's going better that I expected. I mean, we're all alive, so that's something. I've been getting out of the apartment almost every day with both of them, which is no easy feat, but more on that later. And typically by the time Brian gets home both kids are happy, fed, and changed. So I think we're doing alright.

The apartment on the other hand... is trashed. I've always prided myself on being able to maintain a clean and tidy home. I love the principals of minimalism, so we really don't have that much stuff. But in a small space, a little clutter goes a long way. And lately it seems like Hazel loves to pull out every toy we own and gets mad at me when I try to put any of her things away. I find myself rushing to tidy up when she’s not looking or paying attention, because if she notices what I’m doing she’ll shout, “NO!” at the top of her lungs. The good news is she's getting better at keeping herself entertained which gives me pockets of time here and there to get a few things done.

Another big adjustment with two has been the time it takes to get anywhere. Brian says getting out of our apartment is like, "launching into space,” and it honestly feels that way. It already took a lot of time to get out of the house with Hazel, but it seems to take double the time with two. The diaper bag has to be packed with snacks, diapers and wipes for both kids, water bottles, a blanket and binky for Wallace, plus my phone, keys, and sunglasses. Both kids need to be changed and dressed. Hazel’s hair needs to be done. I need to get dressed and do my hair and makeup (nothing fancy these days. I don't have time for that). Baby gets strapped into the carrier so we can walk to the parking garage. Then shoes and jackets for everyone. 

Then there’s the matter of actually getting out of our building and to the car. There are 16 steps from our apartment on the second floor down to the lobby which Hazel usually insists on walking down herself. Then another 5 steps to the main door and a gate we have to open to get outside. Then we walk 2 blocks, mostly uphill, to get to the parking garage. And once we get there I have to strap both kids into their car seats. It's A LOT.

All this to say, before Brian went back to work getting out of the apartment with both kids by myself seemed impossible. But we've actually managed to get out almost every day. I've been strategic about it – Most of our plans have involved meeting up with one of my friends and her kid(s). It makes me feel more comfortable to have another adult around just in case I need some extra help. Plus if there is another kid for Hazel to run around with she's a little less likely to need things from me. That comes in handy when Wallace needs my attention.

Everyday feels long and is filled with a mix of good moments (Hazel started saying "Thank you Mama" this past week and it melts me every time) and bad ones (which usually entails Wallace crying or Hazel yelling at me about something ridiculous like not wanting to wear pants outside and I just want to take a nap, or cry, or yell back).

Take Monday for example. We had a great first half of the day. I took the kids to a park in the morning where we met up with friends and Hazel played for a couple hours. We came home, ate some lunch, and then I managed to get both kids to take a nap at the same time. But then they both woke up, and I could tell right away Hazel hadn't slept long enough. She was grumpy and wanted me to hold her, but Wallace started crying and needed to eat. I tried to keep him pacified (literally) for as long as I could, but eventually I had to feed him, and Hazel wasn't having it. She screamed and cried and yelled at me for the majority of his feeding. I tried talking to her, singing to her, distracting her with nearby toys, but nothing worked. All I could do was wait it out. Eventually she calmed down and started playing again, and the rest of our afternoon went by smoothly. Then at end of our day when Brian came home from work she ran across the apartment, like she always does, yelling "Dada! Back!" and gave him a big hug.

Do you see what I mean? It can go from fun, adorable bliss one second to complete chaos the next, and then back again.

Fortunately it turns out Wallace is the happiest, smiliest baby ever, and even though my life feels out of control right now, I love having him around. I used to think Hazel was a pretty easy newborn, but now I’m not so sure. She slept better at night than Wally does, but was more demanding during the day. She wanted to be held all the time and the majority of her naps took place in my arms until we sleep trained her. Wallace will act a little tired and I'll just zip him up in his sleep sack and place him in the bassinet. Within minutes he goes right to sleep all on his own. It's blowing my mind. That's not to say Wally isn't demanding too – No matter how hard I try to stretch out his feedings the kid likes to eat every two hours. Which usually means he's screaming at the top of his lungs by the time we get home from any of our outings. It's very dramatic and concerning Hazel who says "Baby. Crying. Binky" when he's freaking out. His appetite has turned him into a deliciously chubby baby though, so that's been fun. 

I feel like I should wrap up this post with some sort of "But my children are wonderful so it's fine! Everything's fine! It's all good!" And they are wonderful, but I don't know if if I can say everything's fine. I'm definitely not getting enough sleep, I feel like I'm nursing all the time, my body feels soft and big and foreign to me, and Hazel kicks my butt daily. So instead I keep telling myself "times and seasons." Someday I'll get more sleep, and I know I'll miss the days when Hazel was learning to talk and said everything so cute in her little girl voice, and Wallace was a squishy newborn with multiple arm rolls. But right now? Right now I could really use a good nights sleep (oh and a magical fairy to put all my laundry away, meal plan, and do all my dishes. That would be great).
