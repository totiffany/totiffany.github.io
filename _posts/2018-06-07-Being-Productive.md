I’ve been thinking a lot about productivity this week. Since becoming a mom I’ve had to come to terms with the fact that I simply cannot get as much done in a day as I used to. It's been a tough reality for me to adjust to, as I've always taken pride in my ability to check things off a to-do list. 

I remember about a month after Hazel was born Brian went back to work. It was the first time I had her all to myself for most of the day. I was feeling good, so I tried to tidy the apartment, do the dishes, and tackle some laundry, all while taking care of my tiny newborn. By the time Brian came home the house was messier than he'd left it with piles of laundry everywhere. When I started to apologize he told me I needed me to slow down and be easier on myself. 

Since then I've tried to take his advice and be more realistic about how much I can get done every day with a baby in tow. I came across this funny quote the other day that said, "We can't both look good. It's me or the house." For me, that is so true! I do enjoy having a clean, organized home, and I work hard to prioritize that as best I can. But that means most days my hair and makeup definitely isn't 10/10. (Hazel also likes to follow me into the bathroom and unroll the toilet paper or flush the toilet or reach for the plunger, which doesn't make it any easier. I've become really good at a 2-minute makeup routine).

My biggest tip to getting stuff done is to think of just one or two things I want to get done that day, and then tackle them during naptime. I like to think of Hazel's naps as kind of a "power hour" where I can check off my to-do list. This works for me most of the time, but I've noticed I'll sometimes actively avoid whatever I put on my own to-do list. I'm not sure if it's the rebel in me, or just old-fashioned procrastination, but I'll do anything BUT the one thing I tell myself I need to get done. (I will get it done eventually but in my own time, and in my own way). 

The to-do list never quits. We all have to eat which requires some semblance of meal planning, grocery shopping, and more dishes. I have to change Hazel's diaper, I don’t know, a million times a day. There are always dishes in the sink and more laundry to do. It's annoying to me that laundry and dishes will never be completely DONE. 

There are some days I feel super motivated, and I'm able to keep the house tidy and get dinner on the table, but other days where I don't feel up to anything, and I end up on Netflix while Hazel is napping because I just need a break. And I have to remind myself that that's ok! Our value as mothers doesn't come from how much stuff we get done. Although it can certainly feel that way sometimes. I know I feel much better about myself at the end of a productive day. But I believe all of us have inherent value regardless of what we manage to check off our to-do list. 

So give yourself a break mama! You are doing just fine.
