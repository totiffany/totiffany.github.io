A couple years ago I found myself in a rut. I wasn’t progressing the way I wanted to in my personal or professional life, and was just feeling stuck. I decided what I needed was a creative hobby. Aside from reading and trying every bakery in San Francisco, I realized I didn't have a lot of hobbies. I wanted something I could get excited about outside of work. 

First I turned to [adult coloring books](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1945710799/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=redletterda04-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1945710799&linkId=3ac6311301303911d1a6c0eeb586f928), which have found recent popularity and are known to reduce stress, but it didn’t stick. I really enjoyed coloring and drawing as a kid, so I thought this would be a natural fit, but something about the intricate patterns of adult coloring books frustrated me. I didn’t have the patience for it. 

Then I tried cross-stitch, which despite also requiring a lot of patience, I actually loved. You can find a lot of [cute, modern cross-stitch patterns and DIY kits on etsy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/73305318/mermaid-cross-stitch-kit-diy-kit?ga_search_query=mermaid&ref=shop_items_search_2), and I found the whole process rather meditative. It’s easy to learn and calmingly repetitive. The biggest issue I ran into with this one was finding the right materials. We don’t have a lot of craft stores in the city, and I had a hard time finding thread online that wasn’t super expensive. At one point I even had a friend mail me the materials I needed, but that wasn’t really practical. 

Finally I decided to take a [jewelry making class](http://www.workshopsf.org/). I went by myself, which is something I would never normally feel comfortable doing, but I was really committed to finding a hobby! The class focused on natural gemstone jewelry and wire wrapping and made me remember how much I loved natural stones and geodes growing up. They’re a regular feature in the gift shops of Yellowstone National Park and Jackson Hole, Wyoming near where I’m from. 

So using what I’d learned about a year ago I decided to take it one step further and open my own Etsy shop! It's called [Gem State Co](https://www.etsy.com/shop/GemStateCo/). and I sell sliced geode and druzy necklaces. Learning the ins and outs of Etsy has been a hobby in itself. Curating and ordering materials, creating the product, photographing, editing, and creating listings is a ton of work, but I’ve really enjoyed the entire process. 

I didn't expect much to happen with it, but in the year since I opened my shop I've managed to sell out of nearly every necklace! The whole experience has taught me I need to stop being afraid to try new things. Life is too short to worry that I won't be good enough at something to not give it a shot. And the best way to learn is by just diving in and figuring things out along the way. 

In the spirit of that I'm still trying out new things and new, creative hobbies. I recently created a macrame wall hanging and loved the creative process that went into that. I'm planning to add it to the shop soon. 

What about you? Have you ever been afraid to try something you secretly wanted to do? What creative hobby do you turn to when you find yourself in a rut?  I'd love to hear about it.
