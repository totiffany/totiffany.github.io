Since quitting my job a few months ago Brian and I have had to rethink our budget, and I've been trying to take a more thoughtful approach to how I'm spending. But it seems every week there is something that tempts me to spend more than I planned. Just recently there was the Amazon Prime Day sale and now the Nordstrom Anniversary Sale that's wrapping up this weekend. I love a good deal, but I don't love the pressure that comes with big sales to overspend.

I'm happy to say that the Amazon sale came and went and I didn't buy a thing. I tried to really think about whether or not I would use the items I was eyeing in those "best of Amazon Prime Day" lists. For example, I was super tempted by that [full set of Harry Potter DVD's](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005OCFGTO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B005OCFGTO&linkCode=as2&tag=redletterda04-20&linkId=72de3d378617b065bc6e30248b8da981). It was a killer deal, all 8 DVDs for around $20, but I managed to talk myself out of it. Realistically I can't remember the last time I sat down to watch Harry Potter, and I know I don't like storing DVDs. As for the Nordstrom Sale I managed to steer clear until earlier this week when I bought [exactly one t-shirt](https://shop.nordstrom.com/s/madewell-lo-fi-shrunken-tee/5077241?cm_mmc=email_tran-_-073118-_-order_confirm-_-proddescr1&cm_em=). It's a basic striped tee that I know I'll get a lot of wear out of.

So since money and spending habits are top of mind for me I thought I'd share some of my favorite tools for saving money this week. These are in no way sponsored. I just genuinely love this stuff. 

**[The Drop App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drop-free-cash-rewards/id1090987006?mt=8)**. I'm not entirely sure how or why this app works I just know that it does. Drop lets you earn gift cards for the money you're already spending. All you have to do is link up your credit cards and the app gives you points whenever you make a purchase. Once you have enough points you can cash them out for gift cards to Amazon, Old Navy, Ulta, you name it. I usually cash mine out for a gift card to Gap and buy most of Hazel's baby clothes that way. It's such an easy way to make some extra cash without changing your spending habits.

**[Simple Bank](https://www.simple.com/)**. This is the bank Brian and I use and it's just the best. One of my biggest issues with banks I've used in the past is the hidden fees you get hit with and how difficult their websites and apps are to use. Simple Bank has no fees and their website and mobile app are beautiful. Seriously. One of their coolest features is being able to set up goals in your account. You tell Simple how much you would like to save and it incrementally sets aside money for you towards that goal. So when I log in I can see my "safe to spend" amount and, separately, how much money I have saved up in goals.

**[The NerdWallet App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nerdwallet-credit-score-cash/id1174471607?mt=8)**. What kind of wife would I be if I didn't put a plug in for the company Brian works for? NerdWallet lets you see all your finances in one place. It's also an awesome source for advice and knowledge on financial topics. They recently redesigned their mobile app and it's just fantastic. It looks good, it's easy to use, and gives you an easy breakdown of your spending habits. I like that it compares your overall spending this month vs. last month. 

**[The Target Redcard](https://www.target.com/c/redcard/-/N-4tfyn)**. I will blab about this card to anyone who will listen. Redcard saves you 5% on every Target purchase, you get free 2 day shipping, and an extra 30 days to return items. The best part is you don't have to sign up for it as a credit card (unless you want to of course). They have a debit card option that can link up to your existing checking account. Anyone who knows me knows I am a huge Target fan, so for me, this card is gold. 

Do you have any favorite apps or tools you use to save money? Let's hear them!
