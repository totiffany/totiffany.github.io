Welcome to our apartment! When we found this place we couldn't believe how spacious it was. I've mentioned this before, but our old apartment was really small – Only 311 square feet! So to us, this was an amazing upgrade. A few other perks are that it doesn't face the street, which means it's not as noisy, and the back bay window faces a green courtyard. I've also been really happy with the closets. Good storage is a must when you're living in the city!

Many of the apartments in downtown San Francisco were built during the 1930's-40's, and they were made to last. There's a few key pieces of architecture you'll see in the apartments built at this time – The original hardwood floors, white hex tile in the bathrooms, tons of crown molding, and the signature bay windows. All details we love and enjoy in this apartment.

I get a lot of questions about our rug, so we'll start there. It's from Land of Nod (now Crate and Kids) and it's been wonderful! We originally wanted a red rug for this room, but couldn't find one we liked and ended up going with this one. As rugs go I guess it's kind of a bold choice, but the pattern and color is great for not showing much wear. Unfortunately I no longer see this exact rug on their site, but they have a great selection.

I wanted Hazel to have a good amount of space to play in this apartment, so we made her bookshelf front and center in the living room. Right now all of her toys and books live in that bookshelf, and I'd like to keep it that way, but we'll see. The baskets are all from IKEA, and I love how organized they make it look even though the inside of those baskets is chaos. We keep all of our cords, router, etc. in that wicker basket on top of her bookshelf. If anyone has any better ideas for keeping cords out of reach of a toddler in a stylish way please let me know! 

When we have people over they often ask what that is on the wall behind Hazel's bookshelf. We pretty sure it used to be a murphy bed! It's all sealed up now, but I like that they left it there. It gives it some history and San Francisco charm. On the other side of that wall is Hazel's closet, and it actually has a mirror on that side that she likes to look at herself in. 

Another question we sometimes get is why we don't have a television. When we were first married we couldn't really afford to buy a tv and just haven't found a reason to buy one since! We still watch plenty of tv on our laptops, so it's not that we're against television, and maybe we'll get one someday. But for now, we don't feel like we need one.  

Our couch is from Blue Dot and was one of the first things we bought when we moved in. We moved from a small studio where there wasn't room for a couch, so we were really excited to have one again! I thought it would take us a long time to pick out a couch (it's a big purchase!), but Brian found this one pretty quickly. Blue Dot has a showroom in San Francisco, so we were able to test it out before we purchased it, which made the decision easier. Also, did you guys know you can negotiate a discount on furniture? That was a new experience for us, and we were really happy with the price we ended up buying it for. Our dining table is from Wayfair and the chairs are from West Elm. I was worried the table and chairs wouldn't match, but the wood color is so similar they look like a set! 

Brian designed the large black and white prints we have on the wall behind the couch. They turned out much bigger than I anticipated, and I wasn't too sure about covering that much of our wall space at first, but now I like them up there. Artwork is such a fun and easy way to customize your space, and I like that you can always change it out if you're craving a change. 

Can you tell we love plants? They're everywhere! We've had to push the big ones behind some baskets next to the couch so Hazel doesn't get into them. Hopefully she'll eventually learn not to do that, but for now, they are tucked away. That fiddle fig tree is actually a rescue from our old apartment. I found it dying in our courtyard, so I brought inside and we nursed it back to health. Now it's huge and thriving! 

Moving into the bedroom, Brian and I are huge IKEA fans and that's where our bedframe is from. I like how simple and minimal it is. We have two layered rugs in this room. My brother bought the top patterned one for us on a trip to Peru, and we put a bigger one underneath it to dampen some of the noise from Hazel's baby feet (she just started walking a couple weeks ago!)

The prints above our bed are a city map of San Francisco and NYC (where we lived for a summer after we were first married). My mom bought those for us, so I don't have a source for them. We like to keep our bedding really simple and white. I normally have a big fluffy duvet on the bed, but it's been warmer lately so we switched it out for a thinner one. The throw pillows and nightstand are old from Target. The sconces are from Urban Outfitters and were a pain to install, but I love having a lamp to read with at night.

I'm not sure how I would describe the style of our apartment. I like to keep things minimal, but I'm not afraid of color. And I don't stick to a specific color palette. We moved in just before Hazel was born and I knew I wanted our home to be a place where our baby could run around and have fun. I think you have to be flexible with the design with a baby living there. Now when we're shopping for home goods it's not just our style we have to consider, we also think about whether or not it will work with a baby at home. Nothing too fragile or delicate with sharp corners! Which is why we don't have a coffee table and probably won't get one anytime soon. 

I think that's it! Let me know if I missed anything you'd like a source for.
