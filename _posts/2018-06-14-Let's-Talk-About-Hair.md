Pictures coming soon!

When it comes to hair care I'm a big believer in the less is more approach. I get a haircut maybe twice a year when the length starts to bug me, and I don't use a lot of products. Maybe one of these days I'll actually get haircuts regularly, but for now, I let it grow out until I start craving a change, and then I'll chop it or color it. Sometimes both. 

During pregnancy I saw a noticeable difference in my hair. I was losing a lot less of it, so it got thicker and shinier. But a few months after Hazel was born post-partum hair loss hit me hard. I was losing all the hair I had kept while I was pregnant, and it was everywhere. I felt like I was covered in hair. It was all over me, all over Hazel, the apartment, the shower. It was awful.

I feel like things have evened since then, but now I have all these short hairs from where my hair is growing back in that I'm not sure what to do with. There are so many of them I think my hair looks strange if I try to put it up into a ponytail or a bun. The shorter hairs like to frizz up and stick out everywhere. So most days I leave my hair down. 

Another strange thing happened after my hair loss evened out. My hair started growing like a weed and now it's the longest it's ever been. It's actually gotten pretty heavy and has become a pain to style, but I'm hesitant to chop it as this is the first time I've ever had really long hair. So for now, it stays. 

In terms of styling, I like an imperfect/undone look and my go-to style is soft waves. I usually let my hair air dry and then add a few curls in with a 1-inch curling iron. I've been curling my hair the same way since middle school. I hold the curling iron upside down and wrap my hair around the barrel. I don't blow dry my hair that often because it just takes too long, but when I do I use the [BaBylissPRO Dryer](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ASDGK8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000ASDGK8&linkCode=as2&tag=redletterda04-20&linkId=9dbafc3b9976f4a735c8eb6970825ebd). Before I owned this hairdryer I'd never spent more than $25 on one, but I finally decided to purchase a nice one and its cut my drying time in half. #worthit

In terms of shampoo and conditioner, I have a really sensitive scalp and for that reason, I tend to lean towards the more natural and organic brands. Most recently, I've been trying out the [Shea Moisture Raw Shea Shampoo](https://www.target.com/p/sheamoisture-174-raw-shea-butter-moisture-retention-shampoo-13-fl-oz/-/A-12239777). For conditioner, I've been loving the [Living Proof Restore Conditioner](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005BQ7J5W/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B005BQ7J5W&linkCode=as2&tag=redletterda04-20&linkId=6628ce93e272b2cdf1a61597e999ce2b), but it's a pricier option and I'll likely switch to something else once it's out. 

Product-wise I'm obsessed with the [Kristin Ess Hair line at Target](https://www.target.com/bp/kristin+ess). [Kristin Ess](https://www.instagram.com/kristin_ess/?hl=en) is a celebrity hairstylist whose client list includes Lauren Conrad, and if it's good enough for Lauren it's good enough for me. You can tell a lot of love and experience went into this line, and for the quality of the products, you can't beat the price. My personal favorites are the [working texture spray](https://www.target.com/p/kristin-ess-dry-finish-working-texture-spray-6-9oz/-/A-51397116) and [dry shampoo](https://www.target.com/p/kristin-ess-style-reviving-dry-shampoo-4oz/-/A-51423847). The texture spray keeps things in one place while giving your hair a bit of grit, and the dry shampoo keeps my oily scalp at bay. I will say all of her products have a strong, signature scent that I love, but if you have a sensitive nose it might not be for you. 

I have a lot of natural curl in my hair and have tried a ton of products over the years to tame it. For me, the holy grail of styling products is [Miss Jessie's Quick Curls](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SKUFOQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B002SKUFOQ&linkCode=as2&tag=redletterda04-20&linkId=dde5a70cbceda72911e5962c606e8875). I brush my hair out with a [Wet Brush](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005LPN8R6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B005LPN8R6&linkCode=as2&tag=redletterda04-20&linkId=4ff751ac777f2bf3acb94337583afcd4) and work a dime size amount of this into my hair. It creates soft, natural looking curls that aren't crunchy. 

So there you have it! More than you ever wanted to know about my hair and favorite hair care products. Any tips for post-partum hair loss? Send them my way please.
