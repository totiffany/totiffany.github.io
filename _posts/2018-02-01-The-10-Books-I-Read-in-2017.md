I read exactly 10 books in 2017. It was actually the first year I started keeping track. My gut tells me I usually read more, but it was tough to keep up with it after Hazel was born. And since holding a book and a baby at the same time wasn't really an option, I turned to audiobooks. I'm not sure what took me so long. Listening to a book is a multitasking superpower. I can listen while tackling daily tasks like laundry, cooking, cleaning, and nursing.

I use the Overdrive app to listen to audiobooks and can't recommend it enough. Overdrive lets you borrow audiobooks for free through the library. The only catch is the selection is limited to your local library, and sometimes you have to wait for someone to "return" an audiobook before you can check it out. But if you can have a little patience, it's worth it.

Audiobooks' greatness aside, I wanted to share, in order, the 10 books I read last year. Some were great, others were not so great. Here we go.

She's talented at creating real characters that are flawed, but likable. This one is about a woman named Alice who wakes up from a head injury and can't remember the last 10 years of her life. She thinks she's madly in love with her husband and pregnant with their first baby. The reality is, she's in the middle of a divorce and has three children. It's a good story about forgiveness and fresh starts.

There were so many great recommendations, including this book. While the advice in it seems a bit dated (she says gel is the single best product for curly hair and outlines a specific way to apply it that I tried, but didn't work for me), I appreciated the, "Let's embrace our natural curls!" attitude.

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/150111722X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=150111722X&linkCode=as2&tag=redletterda04-20&linkId=7cbe7348a5a5045cca354eb0e9b22c82">**Scrappy Little Nobody**</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=redletterda04-20&l=am2&o=1&a=150111722X" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> Anna Kendrick is hilarious and this was a great, easy read. In this book, she shares charmingly ordinary stories that have happened in her life, mostly about her rise to fame. I loved the chapters where she talks about dating and what on-screen kisses are really like. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0545284104/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0545284104&linkCode=as2&tag=redletterda04-20&linkId=3414eac2ffb2ed34ba8a169eb7556530">**Abandon**</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=redletterda04-20&l=am2&o=1&a=0545284104" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> A little background on this one – I was a big Meg Cabot fan in high school, so when the opportunity came to go to a book signing with her I couldn't pass it up. This was the book she was on tour for at the time, and it sat on my shelf for 5 years before I got around to reading it. Now I know why. It's a modern retelling of the Greek myth of Persephone, which is a cool premise, but I would pass on this one. The writing was choppy, and I was constantly frustrated by the heroine's poor decisions. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393352307/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0393352307&linkCode=as2&tag=redletterda04-20&linkId=dc8e745d144732de0bccfe61fe0aaa59">**The Unfortunate Importance of Beauty**</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=redletterda04-20&l=am2&o=1&a=0393352307" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> This book starts out nice enough. It's about a group of talented, creative friends who live in New York City. But it quickly takes a strange turn for the supernatural and bizarre. It's trying to make a statement about the importance society places on women's looks, and I guess it does that in a roundabout way. But at the end of it, I was feeling more confused than anything else. Would not recommend.

The author, Gretchen Rubin, wonders what makes people happy, reads a bunch of books about it, and decides to implement the tips into her life one month at a time for a year. It speaks to my organization-loving soul and her writing makes you feel like you're chatting with a good friend. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1476730776/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1476730776&linkCode=as2&tag=redletterda04-20&linkId=db4f8243bbc194f0dff4c31e5057d2a8">**A Curious Mind**</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=redletterda04-20&l=am2&o=1&a=1476730776" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> Brian Grazer is an Academy Award-winning producer of movies and shows we're all familiar with like A Beautiful Mind, Apollo 13, and Arrested Development. In this book, he talks about how curiosity is an admirable quality and one we don't foster enough. He also shares a peek into his "curiosity conversations" that he's had with people from Oprah to Eminem to Tim Cook, many of whom inspired the scripts for his films.

She interviews folks at Disney, visits the American Girl Place store in New York, and gets an inside view of a pre-school aged beauty pageant. It's fascinating, and as a parent, somewhat terrifying.

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/081298840X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=081298840X&linkCode=as2&tag=redletterda04-20&linkId=91efbd719187ba290c0dfd5f9f02075a">**When Breath Becomes Air**</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=redletterda04-20&l=am2&o=1&a=081298840X" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> This is such a powerful little book. It's tragic, yet I felt strangely uplifted after reading it. It's a true story written by Paul Kalanithi who is diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer at the end of his decade-long training to become a neurosurgeon. He passed away while writing it and his wife had it published after his death. It's a fascinating look at what makes life worth living.

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743201639/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0743201639&linkCode=as2&tag=redletterda04-20&linkId=9f884020f8767df498feb3660b50f642">**Solve Your Child's Sleep Problems**</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=redletterda04-20&l=am2&o=1&a=0743201639" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> Not the most exciting read, but this book was recommended to me when we started running into sleep issues with Hazel, and it seriously changed my life. It's dense, and I must admit I didn't read the entire thing, but the sections on getting your child to sleep at night worked for us. Hazel now sleeps through the night (most nights) and is getting into a good nap routine.
