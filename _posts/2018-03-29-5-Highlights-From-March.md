After a month full of rain the sun finally came back out this week! San Francisco winters aren't bad, but we do tend to get a bit of rain during the colder months. Overall, it was a nice reminder to slow down and take it easy. We needed it because Hazel and I (and now Brian) caught an annoying cold that just wouldn't quit. There was a lot of time spent indoors, reading and baking. It was nice, but we're happy to see the sunshine again. Truth be told I was starting to get a little stir crazy. I finally bought one of those silly looking stroller covers so Hazel and I could go on walks in the rain, and of course by the time it arrived the weather improved. 

On the rare days it wasn't raining we did manage to see a few fun things in the city this month. Here's what we've been up to. 

The Glossier Pop-Up Shop 
Makeup and skincare brand [Glossier](http://bff.glossier.com/) is usually only available online, but they just opened an adorable pop-up shop in SF! [Glossier](http://bff.glossier.com/) has done a great job with the marketing and packaging of their products, and many people feel they are over-hyped. But I've tried a lot of their line, and I've gotta say, I think it's great. The skincare is nice for everyday use, and the makeup is perfect for that "no makeup, makeup" look. My favorite products are the [Boy Brow](https://www.glossier.com/products/boy-brow) and [Priming Moisturizer Rich](https://www.glossier.com/products/priming-moisturizer-rich) (which smells amazing. I put it on every night), and I walked out of the shop with the [Milk Jelly Cleanser](https://www.glossier.com/products/milky-jelly-cleanser) and the [Balm Dotcom in mint](https://www.glossier.com/products/balm-dotcom).

Basik Cafe
A friend and I walked to [Basik Cafe](https://www.yelp.com/biz/basik-cafe-san-francisco) for delicious acai bowls, and now I'm hooked! For those of you who are also acai bowl newbies like me, it's essentially a smoothie bowl made from the acai berry with a bunch of delicious granola, fruit, and honey on top. Aside from having that signature dark purple color, acai is a superfruit full of good things for you. Which means after eating one of these you just feel good! I can't get enough. 

Touring the Haas-Lilienthal House. 
Brian and I have been meaning to tour this place for forever, and we finally did it this month! [The Haas-Lilienthal House](https://www.haas-lilienthalhouse.org) is a Victorian mansion that was spared in the San Francisco 1906 earthquake and fire and has been restored to all of its original glory, with much of the original family's furniture and belongings. It's surprisingly the only Victorian house museum in the city. It was stunning, and I loved imagining what it must have been like to live there. 

Yoga with Adrienne. 
I've been trying to do some form of exercise every day during Hazel's morning nap, and lately, it's been YouTube videos on this channel [Yoga with Adrienne](https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene/). It's very beginner friendly. Most of her videos are around 30 minutes, so I have a hard time coming up with an excuse not to do them. There's a little heat, some stretching, and a bit of deep breathing at the end of each one. I've been doing her TRUE 30 day yoga challenge. It's an easy way to get a nice workout in for the day with a bit of self-care. 

Hazel saying "mama" and just generally being cute. 
Hazel said mama! It was at the end of a long day, and she only said it in desperation while trying to get my attention, but still! She also recently started pulling herself up on things, and it is now her favorite activity. She especially likes to pull herself up on our legs in hopes that we will pick her up. She's a fast crawler and follows me wherever I go in the apartment. She smiles easily (with 5 teeth!), babbles a lot, and just started waving bye-bye. Her smiles and giggles are our favorite thing, and we can't believe she turns 1 next month!
