My heart is hurting this week for all of the children who are being separated from their parents at the U.S. and Mexico border. I normally like to write about lighter, uplifting topics, but it would feel remiss not to discuss this. A big part of what I write about is motherhood and my own relationship with my daughter, and thinking about what these families are going through is devastating to me. I'd like to use what little influence I have to shed some light on the situation. 

First a bit of background about what is going on. I'm going to keep this simple and straightforward, but I encourage you to learn more with the links I've included near the end of this post. 

The majority of people crossing the border are seeking asylum from gang and cartel violence. In most cases, the situation at home is so dangerous, fleeing to the United States to seek asylum is their only option. Asylum means the right to live in another country for people who have to leave their native country as a refugee. 

If you step onto U.S. soil you have the right to seek asylum, but the Trump Administration has enacted a "zero-tolerance" policy against people crossing the border. This means everyone gets prosecuted for illegal entry. In this process, parents are being taken to federal court and their children are taken from them.

Between October 2017 and May 2018, [at least 2,700 children have been split from their parents at the border](https://www.vox.com/2018/6/11/17443198/children-immigrant-families-separated-parents). 1,995 of them were separated over just the last six weeks of that window. This means an average of 45 children are being taken from their parents each day. 

It's every parent's worst nightmare and the news has caused outrage among Americans. Over the past week we demanded change and donated to charities working to reuinite familes. There must be a solution that allows for more compassion, we cried. Families must stay together. Children need their parents. 

Something I haven't seen covered in the news as much is that BOTH parties of Congress presented bills to address the border crisis, but both were shut down by the opposing party. So instead of working to address this horrible crises as a unified government, Democrats refused to support a bill presented by Republicans and vice versa. Can you believe it? 

With Congress at a standstill the president finally signed an executive order yesterday that specifies families can be held together in immigrant detention centers as their cases are being processed. It was a relief, and a step in the right direction, but there is still so much to be done. Thousands of children need to be reunited with their parents, yet [the government has no plan for reuniting them](https://www.vox.com/2018/6/20/17484300/read-trump-executive-order-family-separation-immigration-full-text). And everyone seeking asylum will still be prosecuted. 

So here's what you can do. First, read more about what is going on. This situation is so horrifying it can be easy to be overwhelmed with despair and tune out entirely, but that doesn't help anyone. Educating ourselves is imperative. 

[This article from Vox](https://www.vox.com/2018/6/11/17443198/children-immigrant-families-separated-parents) explains exactly what has been going on at the border. 

[This powerful Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/petit_elefant/status/1008131022280519680) illustrates how difficult immigration can be even when you are highly connected and educated. 

[This beautiful article by Meg Conley](https://medium.com/s/story/suffer-little-children-8a204503eb9e) articulates the sacrifices mothers are willing to make for their children. 

[This Washinton Post article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/laura-bush-separating-children-from-their-parents-at-the-border-breaks-my-heart/2018/06/17/f2df517a-7287-11e8-9780-b1dd6a09b549_story.html?utm_term=.1caf80385988) written by former first lady Laura Bush argues a zero tolerance immigration policy is not the answer. 

Second, if you have the means please consider donating to charities that working to reuinite families. Many of these charities provide free legal services to get these families back together. 

Brian and I have donated to RAICES, the largest immigration legal services provider in Texas which provides legal counsel to those seeking asylum. If you are interested in learning about other ways to donate, [this article provides a great list of ways you can help](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/06/how-you-can-fight-family-separation-at-the-border.html). Every donation counts!

Let's make our voices heard.
