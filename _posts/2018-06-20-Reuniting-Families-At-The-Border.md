My heart is hurting this week for all of the children being separated from their parents at the U.S. and Mexico border. I normally like to write about lighter, uplifting topics, but it would feel remiss not to discuss this. A big part of what I write about is motherhood and my own relationship with my daughter, and thinking about what these families are going through is devastating to me. I'd like to use what little influence I have to shed some light on the situation. 

First a bit of background about what has been going on. I'm going to keep this simple and straightforward, but I encourage you to learn more with the links I've included near the end of this post. 

The majority of people we are hearing about crossing the border are seeking asylum in the United States. Asylum means the right to live in another country for people who have to leave their native country as a refugee. In many cases the situation at home for these families is so dangerous and violent, fleeing to the United States to seek asylum is their only option. 

If you step onto U.S. soil you have the right to seek asylum, but the Trump Administration is enforcing a "zero-tolerance" policy against people crossing the border. This means everyone gets prosecuted for illegal entry. In this process, parents are being taken to federal court and their children are taken from them.

Between April 19 and May 31, [nearly 2000 children were been split from their parents at the border](https://www.npr.org/2018/06/16/620451012/dhs-nearly-2-000-children-separated-from-adults-at-border-in-six-weeks). Which means an average of 45 children were being taken from their parents each day. 

It's every parent's worst nightmare, and the news has caused outrage among Americans. Over the past week we demanded a solution that allows for more compassion. Families must stay together. Children need their parents. 

Something I haven't seen covered in the news as much, but I'd like to quickly highlight, is that [BOTH parties of Congress presented bills to address the crisis and were shut down by the opposing party](http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/393069-schumer-rejects-gop-proposal-to-address-border-crisis). Democrats refused to support a bill presented by Republicans and vice versa. So instead of working to address this as a unified government, it became about politics and loyalty to party.

With Congress at a standstill the president finally signed an executive order yesterday that specifies families can be held together in immigrant detention centers as their cases are being processed. It was a relief, and a step in the right direction, but there is still so much to be done. Thousands of children need to be reunited with their parents, yet [the government has no plan for reuniting them](https://www.vox.com/2018/6/20/17484300/read-trump-executive-order-family-separation-immigration-full-text). And everyone seeking asylum will still be prosecuted. 

So here's what you can do. First, read more about it. This situation is so horrifying it can be easy to get overwhelmed and tune out entirely, but that doesn't help anyone. We must educate ourselves. Here are a few resources I've found to be helpful. 

[This article from Vox](https://www.vox.com/2018/6/11/17443198/children-immigrant-families-separated-parents) explains exactly what has been happening at the border. 

[This Washinton Post article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/laura-bush-separating-children-from-their-parents-at-the-border-breaks-my-heart/2018/06/17/f2df517a-7287-11e8-9780-b1dd6a09b549_story.html?utm_term=.1caf80385988) written by former first lady Laura Bush that insists a zero tolerance immigration policy is not the answer. 

[This powerful Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/petit_elefant/status/1008131022280519680) illustrates how difficult immigration can be even when you are highly connected and educated. 

[This beautiful article by Meg Conley](https://medium.com/s/story/suffer-little-children-8a204503eb9e) articulates the sacrifices mothers are willing to make for their children. 

Second, if you have the means please consider donating to a charity that is working to reunite families. I've chosen to donate to [RAICES](https://actionnetwork.org/fundraising/leafund), the largest immigration legal services provider in Texas which provides legal counsel to those seeking asylum. [You can also donate here](https://actionnetwork.org/fundraising/leafund).

If you are interested in learning about other ways you can help, [this article provides a great list](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/06/how-you-can-fight-family-separation-at-the-border.html). 

Let's make our voices heard. This is not ok.
