  The truth is, I need this blog post more than anyone this week. I've been
  feeling tired and cranky lately. We're headed to southern California for the
  long weekend to visit family, which I am really excited about, but traveling
  always stresses me out. And traveling with a baby even more so. I know it's a
  short trip, and so many people love to travel, but to me nothing about
  airplane travel is fun. I hate the packing, the airport, security, and the
  anxiety of not knowing how Hazel is going to handle the flight. We've been
  lucky so far, historically she's gone right to sleep, but now she's at an age
  where she really needs to move and I'm not sure how it's going to go.

The truth is, I need this blog post more than anyone this week. I've been feeling tired and cranky lately. We're headed to southern California for the long weekend to visit family, which I am really excited about, but traveling always stresses me out. And traveling with a baby even more so. I know it's a short trip, and so many people love to travel, but to me nothing about airplane travel is fun. I hate the packing, the airport, security, and the anxiety of not knowing how Hazel is going to handle the flight. We've been lucky so far, historically she's gone right to sleep, but now she's at an age where she really needs to move and I'm not sure how it's going to go. 

I'd really rather be cool and chill about all this. And deep down I know it will be fine. We'll get through it. But in the meantime, I'll try taking my own advice to relax a bit. Here are five easy and quick ways I like to use when I'm feeling stressed.  

**Make plans with a friend**. I'm getting to an age where I really have to schedule time to be with friends, or it just won't happen. Everyone is busy, and we have to work around our kids' varying nap schedules. And even when I make plans, the thought of sticking to them can be a source of stress. Not that I don't want to see friends, but the sheer amount of work it can take to get myself ready, Hazel ready, and all our baby gear out the door is no easy feat. But I will say I never regret getting out and spending time with people. Catching up with friends reminds me the world is much bigger than my apartment, and I come back feeling happier and energized. 

**Burn a candle**. To me, candles are one of life’s simple luxuries. They’re generally inexpensive and can instantly create a new atmosphere in your home. My favorite candles are the pine-scented ones I burn around Christmastime. We don’t get snow in San Francisco, but that pine scent instantly transports me to a cozy cabin the woods. I do have to be picky about which candles I buy though, as Brian has an unusually strong sense of smell. I tend to gravitate towards “clean” scents like lemon and linen, but he prefers warmer scents like vanilla and cedar. [This candle](https://www.target.com/p/lidded-jar-container-candle-8oz-cedar-magnolia-hearth-hand-153-with-magnolia/-/A-52581015) is a recent favorite we can both agree on. And speaking of great scents...

**Bake something**. I don’t particularly like to cook, because I have to do it. It’s one of life’s daily necessities. Most nights I think, "We have to make dinner again? Didn't we just do this??" Baking, on the other hand, is a luxury –Something you choose to do when you have time for it, and for that reason, I really enjoy it. There’s something relaxing for me about measuring all the ingredients and mixing everything together. Not to mention how incredible banana bread or chocolate chip cookies can make your home smell. 

**Read a book**. This might be an obvious choice, but nothing gets me feeling quite as relaxed as diving into a good fiction book. I just finished [Truly Madly Guilty by Liane Moriarty](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1250069807/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1250069807&linkCode=as2&tag=redletterda04-20&linkId=7fd90c1d754939bc9fb002bf1ac4896a) and couldn't put it down. If you're looking for more of a motivational kick in the pants [The Happiness Project](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062414852/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0062414852&linkCode=as2&tag=redletterda04-20&linkId=7124b1cda11f42e3004d5f077734401f) and [The Compound Effect](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/159315724X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=159315724X&linkCode=as2&tag=redletterda04-20&linkId=cd3f78427167b38d72d91cb7cf7357cb) are two of my all time favs. They focus on how small changes, over time, can make a big impact on your life.

**Book a vacation**. For as much as I hate air travel, I’m all about the next vacation. I love having a break to look forward to. The anticipation of an upcoming trip can be a big source of happiness for me. As the author of The Happiness Project, Gretchen Rubin, [has said](https://gretchenrubin.com/2011/02/my-first-splendid-truth-is-to-tackle-happiness-you-must-think-about-feeling-good-feeling-bad-and-feeling-right-in-an-atm/), “Anticipation is a key stage in happiness; by having something to look forward to, no matter what your circumstances, you bring happiness into your life well before the event actually takes place.”

**Practice some self-care**. For me, this means booking a facial or a massage. I’ve learned some people really don’t like having their faces touched (ahem, Brian), but for me facials are heavenly. I rarely have time to pamper my skin and it feels amazing to have a skin treatment tailored just for me. And massages saved me during pregnancy. They helped keep all the aches and pains at bay and made those nine months manageable. I know facials and massages can get pricey, so I tend to book my facials at a local beauty school and massages only when I’m really starting to feel I need one. 

What are your favorite things to do when you need a pick-me-up? I'd love to hear them!
