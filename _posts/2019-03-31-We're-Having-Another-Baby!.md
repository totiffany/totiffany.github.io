We’re having another baby! A little boy!

My belly really made an appearance over the last month. I already feel huge, and I still have three months to go! Aside from showing much sooner than I did last time (and having a stronger craving for salty, crunchy snacks), everything about this pregnancy feels exactly the same. I’m fortunate in that I don’t get really sick while I’m pregnant, but I do get extremely tired – To a point where even a small task seems overwhelming.

Hazel’s naps have always been precious time for me, but until I was about 16 weeks along I had to take a nap when she did or I quite literally couldn’t function. Most days the thought of getting dressed and out of the apartment was too much for me. I was that exhausted. Thankfully, making it to the second trimester made such a difference. Aside from being frequently out of breath thanks to my bigger belly, I feel so much better. 

I hope this explains why I’ve been quieter on my blog lately. Up until recently I didn’t have the energy to function like a normal human being, so the thought of writing something seemed impossible. And honestly, even now most days I feel like I’m just trying to keep it together. 

While I am excited to meet this little guy, I’ll be honest, I’ve mostly been feeling scared about the transition from one child to two. We got pregnant sooner than we anticipated, and the thought of managing a newborn with a toddler feels overwhelming to me. Hazel will be two years + two months old when the baby arrives. I don’t want her to feel less loved or wanted when we add another baby to the mix, but I know he’s going to demand a lot more of my time and attention. 

The fact that we got pregnant so easily this time really is wonderful. It was just unexpected. I keep thinking I should feel more excited, and instead most days I feel like, “Ok how are we actually going to do this?” I’ve always wanted to be a mom, but it’s so much more work than I ever anticipated, and I’m floored by mothers who have multiple children. All I want in the world right now is more time to work on the things I enjoy and more sleep, and a baby doesn’t allow for either of those things. There have been days when the thought of recovering from childbirth, figuring out breastfeeding and a sleep schedule with a newborn again, changing two sets of diapers, keeping the never-ending pile of laundry under control, all while trying to make sure Hazel’s emotional and physical needs are met brings me to tears. How is it done?

There are still moments when I feel excited of course. This baby has been really active, and I still love putting Brian’s hand on my belly to feel him moving around in there. I’ve always loved little babies and the thought of having another one of our own that we get to hold and cuddle fills me with joy. I think Hazel will be a great big sister. I have a close relationship with my younger brother, and it will be fun to see her in the same role that I’ve always had. But most days I just feel scared. And then I feel guilty for feeling that way when I know I should be feeling more grateful and lucky and excited. 

I’m also wondering if kids can sense when a big change is coming, because Hazel has been really attached to me lately. There’s been lots of crying and whining and clinging for me. And when she refuses to go to her dad because _I just need a minute_ it doesn’t exactly increase my confidence. How is she going to react when I'm often holding and tending to another baby? 

So mamas of two small children, any tips for me? Was there anything you did to make the transition from one to two easier? I’d love to hear from you.
