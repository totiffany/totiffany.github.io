It feels like I just wrote about how much I was loving going back to work after maternity leave, yet here we are. Everything I said in that post holds true. I did like going back to work. I did enjoy having time that was my own again, being around adults, contributing to a team, and that overall feeling of accomplishment. But a few things happened in January that helped me realize I would rather be at home taking care of Hazel.

The first was we had a difficult time finding a new nanny.  The nanny I had lined up after the holidays got a different job, which meant we had to scramble to find someone else. It was hard. It was stressful. And it was enough for me to consider throwing in the towel and watching Hazel myself. Fortunately, we were finally able to find a new nanny, but the whole experience got me thinking more about staying at home. 

The second reason was the two days a week I was working from home weren't really, well, working anymore. Hazel had started rolling around and was wanting more hands-on attention, so I felt terrible about always being on my laptop when we were together. My days in the office were definitely more productive, and I was feeling like I should start going into the office one more day a week. The thought of doing that, however, put a pit in my stomach. I knew I wanted more time with Hazel, not less. 

Finally, and probably the biggest reason, I wasn't feeling super engaged and excited about my work. While I was on maternity leave my team handed a lot of my work off to an agency, and it was tough for me to figure out my place when I came back. The first few weeks of that were fine. I appreciated the slower pace and being able to ease back into things. But after several months of a slow workload, I was wanting more and more to be at home. I know workloads can ebb and flow, so this certainly could have been temporary, but it ultimately helped me make up my mind.

I was worried how my coworkers would react to the news. The bay area is full of ambitious people, and I work with a variety of men and women of varying ages. What would they think of me leaving – Not to take another job, but to be at home with my baby? I'm happy to say the reaction I received was positive. Everyone, particularly parents, were supportive of my choice. I was usually told something along the lines of, "If you can afford it, that's great. You should absolutely take some time to be with her when she is little." Many of the women I talked to confided in me that their husbands stay at home watching the kids and doing freelance work. One woman said her husband had been laid off recently and they weren't in any rush for him to find another job. They liked having him at home. The impression I got was most parents want more time with their children, particularly when they are new and little. I was among friends. I had nothing to worry about. 

I'm proud of myself for going back to work after maternity leave. And I'm proud of myself for leaving too, on my own terms – Not because I feel like I should, or because of any outside pressure to do so, but because it's what I want to do. 

I don't think this is the end of my career. I'd like to keep working in some capacity. I enjoy it. But the whole 40-hour workweek in the office wasn't for me right now. Times and seasons. 


As a sidebar two of the most common questions I get after telling people I've left my job is if we are going to be ok financially and if we are planning to stay in San Francisco. The first question always strikes me as a bit odd, but the answer is we are extremely fortunate to have the financial freedom that allows me to stay at home. While two incomes are always better than one, we wouldn't be doing this if we weren't able to afford it. And yes, we are planning on staying in the city.
