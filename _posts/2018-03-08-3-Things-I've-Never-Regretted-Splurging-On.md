For the most part, Brian and I aren't big spenders. We may live in an expensive city, but we do our best to keep our expenses as low as we can. We've chosen to live in a less-fancy neighborhood to save a bit on rent every month. And we don't have a car, which means we don't have to worry about monthly payments or parking fees. But despite our budget-conscious attitude, there are a few things we've splurged on that I have no regrets about buying.

I've always had the sense that I should avoid spending money as often as possible. We're all familiar with the saying, "Money can't buy happiness," but I've since learned that money spent wisely can actually be a major source of happiness. It just has to be the right purchase for _you_. So even for someone who normally tries to avoid spending a lot of money, here are 3 items I've never regretted splurging on. 

**A High-Quality Mattress**
If you think about it, we spend _so_ much time sleeping it makes sense to invest in a great mattress. Brian hurt his back a few years ago when we were moving a couch into our first apartment, and after that, we decided a high-quality mattress was a must. A friend recommended [Casper](https://casper.com/). At the time it was the only online mattress company I was aware of. Now there are lots to choose from; [Casper](https://casper.com/), [Nectar](https://www.nectarsleep.com/), [Purple](https://purple.com/), etc. They all claim to have developed the perfect mattress they can ship right to your door. I'm really glad Casper was the only one I knew about at the time. It made the choice super easy! It's been an amazing purchase. Nothing can compare to the coziness of this thing. And I swear if I go to bed with any aches or pains this mattress has healed me by morning.

**Wood Coathangers**
After we moved to the city I decided our college days were behind us, and it was time to ditch the plastic coat hangers. We replaced them all with wood ones from [The Container Store](https://www.containerstore.com/s/closet/hangers/wooden/petite-basic-natural-wooden-hangers/123d?productId=11007382), and it's a little ridiculous how happy that purchase has made me. They weren't cheap, but hanging your clothes on a wooden hanger makes them look fantastic. Opening our closets now actually gives me a daily rush of joy. Its also made me better about keeping my closet organized and tidy. I want to keep everything looking nice to match the aesthetic of those hangers.

**Travel**
Brian and I aren't big travelers, but we do try to plan a few fun trips every year. Usually, our trips revolve around seeing family. We always take annual trips to Idaho for the fourth of July and Christmas to see our parents. Last year we also made a visit to see family in Texas and just recently got back from a beach-side vacation with friends in Cabo. We do our best to find decent deals on flights and hotels when we travel. It's still expensive, but in my mind setting aside some funds for trips always pays off. It's worth the extra dollars to have some time to relax and be with the ones you love.
