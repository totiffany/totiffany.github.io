Hi! Hello! How is everyone? It's been a while since I sat down and wrote a proper blog post. One of my goals last year was to try and write something every week, and I made it to October. So I may not have stuck with it the entire year, but three-fourths is pretty good, right?

Blogging is a lot harder than it looks. I respect full-time bloggers and Instagrammers so much more than I used to. Seriously, how do they do it? For me, the big hangup has been finding the time to write every week. The only time I have to open my laptop is during Hazel's naps or after her bedtime. But that's also the only time I have to get everything else done. Sometimes I use that time to tidy the apartment, do dishes, get ready for the day, set appointments, work on church stuff, or write a blog post. Other times I use it to take a nap or watch Netflix, because taking care of a toddler is exhausting and I just need a break. 

Then Christmas happened and something about being in Idaho makes my desire to do pretty much anything go out the window. It's a true winter wonderland, and time seems to stand still there. I saw a lot of wonderful Christmas-themed blog and Instagram posts going out from friends and bloggers I follow and admire in December, but I just couldn't find the motivation to do it myself.  Maybe I was trying to be in the moment with my family. Maybe I was just feeling extra lazy. But whatever the reason from about mid-December to a little past my birthday at the beginning of January, I didn't post a thing. 

Speaking of my birthday, I turned 30! It feels great, and not as scary as I thought it would be. I'm realizing the older you get the less you tend to care about what other people think of you, and there's something so freeing about that. I spent so much time, energy, and anxiety in my teens and 20's worrying about what I looked like or how I presented myself, and now I can just be. I feel happy and lucky and loved. 

Birthdays and new years are a good time to reflect, and I've been trying to figure out what I'd like to do with the next chapter of my life. I'm at a point where I've accomplished all of the big goals I ever set for myself, and I'm only 30! For as long as I can remember I wanted to go to college, get my degree, get married, and have some babies. And I did ALL of that! I have everything I've ever wanted. And it's amazing, and I have a wonderful life, a great husband, and a beautiful daughter, but I also feel like there has to be more, yunno? I can't possibly be done at 30. I want to keep learning and growing, but I'm not exactly sure how or what that looks like yet. 

The same goes for this blog. I like writing and sharing things that have been helpful or interesting to me, but there are things about blogging that I struggle with. Consistency is one, self-promotion is another. Telling people when you've written something is pretty essential to getting them to read it, but I struggle with it all the same. Thankfully, I've heard so much good feedback over the past year from people saying they read this or that blog post and letting me know how much they enjoyed it, and that has been so encouraging! I want this to be fun and enjoyable for you all, so thanks for letting me know when you've read something that was interesting to you, and for sticking with me while I figure it out.  

For now, I'm going to keep writing when I can (aiming for 2x/month this year which feels more doable), playing with my baby (who is sadly not such a baby anymore), reading books I love, trying to make more mom friends, and sharing all my favorite things with you. As always, thank you for reading. Here's to 2019!
