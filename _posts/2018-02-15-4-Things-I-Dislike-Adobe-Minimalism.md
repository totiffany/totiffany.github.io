What's not to like about minimalism? To be clear, there's a difference between the heart of minimalism, which I wrote about last week, and the kind of minimalism we're seeing on Pinterest and Instagram. The things I dislike about minimalism have to do more with what I'd call "aesthetic minimalism," which is, in a word, trendy.

You can see examples of aesthetic minimalism everywhere, and I think it's creating a lot of unhealthy pressure to be perfect. We're flooded with images of beautifully styled homes, devoid of any color, and completely neutral wardrobes. If having these things make you happy, that's great, but don't do it just because that's what's in style. Make sure you are surrounding yourself with things that bring you joy. 

Here are a few other things I take issue with when it comes to minimalism.

It makes you focus more on your material possessions. The whole idea behind minimalism is that once you free yourself of all your extra stuff, you'll have more room for the things you love. The thing is, decluttering your home takes a lot of time and energy, and it's easy to become obsessed with the process. If I wanted to, I could spend every weekend going through our closets and drawers finding stuff to get rid of. But spending too much time thinking about your possessions undermines the point. I want to spend less time thinking about my stuff, not more. 

It can actually make you spend more. This one sounds counterintuitive. Minimalism is about getting rid of stuff. How would that make you spend more? Well, according to The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up, which has become somewhat of a bible for minimalism, you should toss any items that don't "spark joy." The issue is I own a lot of perfectly functional items that don't necessarily spark joy for me. Suddenly my towels and luggage and bedsheets aren't good enough, and I start thinking I should replace everything with nicer, more expensive items. And speaking of that... 

It's just another way to sell us stuff.Â Again, there is a difference between the heart of minimalism and aesthetic minimalism, but the minimalist look is in style. Items are being labeled as "minimalist" in advertising to appeal to our desire for order. You can see it in clothing, beauty products, and home goods. Bright and colorful is out. Neutral and minimalist is in. While I'm all for a well-designed product, you shouldn't purchase something just because it appeals to your desire to be a minimalist. Make sure your purchases are high-quality items you actually want, not just because they come in a pretty package.

All of our donations are creating waste. This is a complicated issue, but I'll try to keep it simple. While donating our extra stuff to thrift shops may seem like the charitable thing to do, we're actually contributing to a massive pollution problem. We are purchasing and donating clothes so often now thrift shops cannot possibly keep up. And when thrift shops can no longer store all of our donated clothing they ship them overseas. Sounds ok so far, right? Well, it turns out the countries we ship to can't keep up with the mass of donations either! As a result, a lot of our clothes are [ending up in landfills or incinerated](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/20/fast-fashion-thrift-stores_n_5798612.html). The best way to combat this is to buy fewer, high-quality items that will last longer and that we intend to keep for a long time. Fewer purchases mean less waste later on.

So there you have it. Do you agree that there's a bit of a dark side to minimalism? Has trying to conform to minimalism actually made you spend more? Let's talk about it.
