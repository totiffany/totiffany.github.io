Pictures coming soon! 

Summer is here! We're headed to Idaho tomorrow for the fourth of July and I can't wait. Both mine and Brian's families live in Idaho, and it will be so fun to see everyone. Bring on the barbecues and fireworks! 

In addition to burgers, watermelon, lemonade, and all the other delicious foods that come with warmer days, summer really gets me in the mood for smoothies. Fun fact – My first job in college was at a Jamba Juice. Remember Jamba Juice?? It was all the rage when I was in high school. Green smoothies weren't really a thing back then, but those bright orange, red, and pink smoothies (that were mostly made of sorbet) were. MMmm. 

I have two smoothie recipes I alternate between depending on what I'm in the mood for. The first is a pink smoothie that's great for breakfast. The oats and peanut butter give it a bit more energy than your typical all fruit smoothie. (And it's reallyyy similar to the one I used to make for myself at the end of a shift at Jamba). 

My other favorite is a green smoothie that doesn't taste like grass! It took me a while to find a green smoothie that was actually palatable, but I finally discovered the secret ingredient – Frozen mango! Put it in your smoothie and you won't even notice the greens.  

One more quick tip. Whenever I make a smoothie I like to throw in some chia seeds. They're nutrient-dense and add a good punch of protein. I buy mine at Trader Joe's, but I'm sure you can find them at most health food stores. 

Green Smoothie
1 cup raw spinach or kale
1 banana
1 cup frozen mango
1 cup milk
1 tsp chia seeds

Pink Smoothie
1 cup frozen strawberries
1 banana
1/2 cup rolled oats
1 TB peanut butter
1 cup milk
1 tsp chia seeds

Blend until smooth and enjoy! If you want to get fancy, you can serve your smoothie in a bowl with toppings like chopped fruit, granola, chia seeds, and coconut shavings. Sometimes I like to eat it from a bowl because makes me feel like I'm eating ice cream, but up to you! Have a great holiday!
