I discovered minimalism a few years ago almost out of necessity. When we moved to San Francisco all we could afford was a studio apartment. We sold most of our furniture before the move but still struggled to squeeze all of our stuff into that tiny place. There was enough room for a bed and two sitting chairs. That was it. We had a good closet by the front door, which helped, and I went to work organizing our belongings as best I could. It was somewhere around that time I saw [this Ted Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/graham_hill_less_stuff_more_happiness) and felt inspired. We don't need stuff! Ged rid of all the things!

That extra set of measuring cups? Gone. The dress I hadn't worn in forever? Into the donation bin. Slowly, but surely, we managed to feel comfortable in that apartment, and something fun happened â€“ We discovered we were happy living small! When I walked in the door I felt lighter and more content. 

I've studied minimalism quite a bit since then, and it turns out, it's not just about stuff. While minimalism is tough to define I like [this elevator pitch](https://www.theminimalists.com/pitch/) best, "Minimalism is a lifestyle that helps people question what things add value to their lives."

When we think of the minimalism movement we tend to think of really extreme lifestyles where people only own 5 shirts and 2 pairs of shoes. But for me, that's too extreme. While I love a good, curated closet, minimalism is going to look different depending on who you are and what's important to you. Giving away a bunch of your stuff doesn't necessarily make you a minimalist. Reassessing your priorities, and making more room for the things, people, and activities that add joy to your life does.

For me, this is an ongoing process. I enjoy books and shoes and skincare, and my possessions reflect that. But I love the idea of collecting items that truly have value and meaning to you. No more impulse buys. I want to love what I own and make purchases I intend to keep for a long time.
