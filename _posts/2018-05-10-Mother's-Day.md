It's been a little over a year since Hazel made me a mother. Around this time last year I was still recovering from her birth and definitely not getting enough sleep. So much has changed since then. Hazel has gotten so big. Brian and I comment on it every day. Where did our tiny baby go? How is she almost walking?

As Mother’s Day approaches this Sunday I’ve been thinking a lot about how becoming a mother has changed me over the past year. Here are just a few of ways I feel I've changed...

I now know exactly what my favorite baby products are, and I love buying those things for other mamas. I never used to know what to give mothers at baby showers. The sizing of baby clothes confused me, and I wasn't sure which books or toys were age appropriate. I would usually get them a cute towel and bath products, which is a fine gift, but not as fun as some of the stuff I know about now. 

I’ve become much more aware of how much time I spend looking at my phone or laptop. And I’ve realized I don’t want to miss out on real life by staring at a screen. I try my best to not be on my phone when I’m around Hazel, but it’s a lot harder than you'd think. I’ve noticed I’ll often pick it up to check the time and end up scrolling mindlessly. I’ve started wearing a watch so I can check the time without getting sucked in.

I have developed more respect and awe for my body and really, for all women. Every mother I meet I am filled with respect and admiration for. We have been through so much. I’m not sure where the perception came from that women are not physically strong. We are designed to endure intense amounts of pain for long periods of time. And I can’t believe our bodies go through all that and then they recover. They heal! It’s incredible. 

I have a deeper appreciation for modern medicine that allowed me to monitor my baby’s progress every step of my pregnancy and have a comfortable, safe delivery. I’ve also realized I am privileged to have every expectation that my daughter will thrive and live to adulthood. [Even just 60 years ago that wasn’t the case](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2012/10/16/162670836/wiping-out-polio-how-the-u-s-snuffed-out-a-killer).

I’ve developed more respect, appreciation, and understanding for my own mother. My mother and I are different, we certainly did not get along in my teenage years, but now I can’t believe I was ever mean to her. Mothers sacrifice so much of themselves for their children. I owe her a debt of love and service I can only repay by paying it forward. 

I'm not sure how best to explain this one, but I've deloped an almost overwhelming desire to help _everyone_. I’ve started to look at other people as children. I’ve realized that every person is someone’s child. I have a harder time with movies or books or stories in the news about children who are suffering. I was sensitive to it before, but now it makes me want to curl up in a ball and cry. I can't reconcile how my daughter can be safe and warm at home when so many children in the world want for so much. 

And perhaps most important of all, becoming a mother has affirmed my belief in God. Throughout this experience I have felt his influence and love. I know there is something much bigger than me at work here. 

I wish you all a wonderful Mother's Day! May the mothers in our lives feel celebrated and honored for they do.
