My coworkers were the first to tell me about bullet journaling. Over lunch they explained it was a journal and planner all in one, and "whatever you want it to be." It seemed too vague and complicated to appeal to me, so I wasn't convinced until I watched [this video](http://bulletjournal.com) by the creator of the bullet journal system. 

I've tried a variety of digital options when it comes to my to-do lists, but have realized I'm forever a pen and paper kind of girl. I tend to keep track of things everywhere though – On a spare notepad, sticky notes, in the calendar on my phone. I liked the idea of condensing all that into one notebook and figured I could give bullet journaling a try. 

The bullet journal is described as "an analogue system for a digital age," and it's not nearly as complicated as it sounds. It only took about 30 minutes to get my notebook set up, and then I filled it in with anything I could think of – birthdays, appointments, my to-do list. Sure enough, it feels great to have it all in one place. I've been using my bullet journal for just over a year now, and I've gotta say, _it works_. 

For those of you who are new to bullet journaling here are a few tips I've picked up that might help you get started. This thing is honestly what keeps me organized and sane. 

**Learn the basics.**
There's no way I can explain bullet journaling as well as the creator does in [this video](http://bulletjournal.com), so I highly recommend watching it first. He explains the original system for setting up your bullet journal and the meaning behind all those fancy words like "future log" and "migration." I had to watch it a couple times before everything clicked, but once I saw the wisdom in it I was sold. 

**Do what works for you. Toss what doesn't.** 
The original bullet journal system is simple enough, but creative women on Instagram have since gotten hold of it and made [insanely beautiful layouts](https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/6-instagram-must-follows-for-the-bullet-journal-obsessed-238787). It's super intimidating and made me want to quit before I even got started. But I decided if I was going to actually use the thing it would need to be a system that worked for me. That means, for the most part, I've kept to the original version presented in the video.

**Treat yourself to a great notebook + pen.**
Brian has been using a dotted notebook for years and I never saw the appeal of it for myself until now. There is an [official bullet journal notebook](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B016WKV8UC/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B016WKV8UC&linkCode=as2&tag=redletterda04-20&linkId=6837fab1c1830ce042035bb50aa89c93) you can purchase, but I've been using the [Molskine dotted notebook](https://us.moleskine.com/en/classic-notebook-black/p0460), and it works just as well. As for the right pen, I was never particular about my pens until my mom gave me the over Christmas. She was inspired to purchase it after learning it was ranked as one of the best pens out there, and I'm here to tell you, she's right. Do yourself a favor and get a couple of them. It's a simple luxury to write with a nice pen.
