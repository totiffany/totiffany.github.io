I've tried a variety of digital options when it comes to keeping track of my to-do lists, but have realized I'm forever a pen and paper kind of gal. But I tend to keep track of things everywhere – In a spare notebook, on sticky notes, in the calendar on my phone. It's never been very efficient. 

My coworkers were the first to tell me about bullet journaling. They said it was a journal and planner all in one, and "whatever you want it to be." It seemed too vague and complicated to appeal to me, so I wasn't convinced until I watched [this video](http://bulletjournal.com) by the creator of the bullet journal system. I liked the idea of condensing all of my scraps of paper into one place and figured I could give it a try. 

It only takes about 30 minutes to get your bullet journal set up, and once I did I filled it in with everything I could think of – birthdays, appointments, my to-do list. It felt great to have everything in one place. I've been using it for just over a year now, and I'm so happy to have found something that has stuck. It's easy, it's flexible, and it is honestly what keeps me organized and sane. 

For those of you who are new to bullet journaling here are a few tips I've picked up that might help you get started. I can't recommend it enough! 

**Learn the basics.**
There's no way I can explain bullet journaling as well as the creator does in [this video](http://bulletjournal.com), so I highly recommend watching it first. He explains the original system for setting up your bullet journal and the meaning behind all those fancy words like "future log" and "migration." I had to watch it a couple times before it all clicked, but once I saw the wisdom in it I was sold. 

**Do what works for you. Toss what doesn't.** 
The original bullet journal system is simple enough, but creative women on Instagram have since gotten hold of it and made [insanely beautiful layouts](https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/6-instagram-must-follows-for-the-bullet-journal-obsessed-238787). It's super intimidating and made me want to quit before I'd even began. But I decided if it was going to actually use the thing it would need to be a system that worked for me. That means, for the most part, I've kept to the basic version presented in the video.

**Treat yourself to a great notebook + pen.**
Brian has been using a pegged notebook for years and I never saw the appeal of it for myself until now. There is an official bullet journal notebook you can purchase, but I've been using the Molskin pegged notebook and it works just as well. As for the right pen, I was never particular about my pens until my mom gave me the ____ over Christmas. She said it was rated as one of the best pens out there, and I'm here to tell you, it's the truth. Do yourself a favor and get a couple of them. It's a simple luxury to write with a nice pen.
