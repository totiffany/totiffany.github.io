My little sister graduated from college today! I'm feeling so proud of her and all the hard work that went into her degree. College is a ton of work, time, and grit, and I remember feeling elated when it was over. But the transition from college to the working world wasn't an easy one for me. It felt like everyone had their plans figured out and I didn't. Now six years later, my sister is feeling the same way. We've been having lots of conversations over the past few weeks about the stress of the job hunt as she looks for that first, entry-level job.

It's made me reflect on my own experience right after college. I graduated ready to take on the world, but to my surprise job opportunities were not banging down my door. I had several internships under my belt, which I had been told would make me a more competitive job candidate, but nobody seemed to care. I was unemployed for two months before I found a job. And even then it was only through a connection from a girl I knew at church. 

It some ways it was a good job. My boss was great. It had decent benefits. The salary was meager, but it allowed Brian and I to stay on our feet while we saved up for his internship in New York the following summer. But most days I felt like a robot. I followed a specific step by step process to get my job done, and I definitely wasn't using my degree. 

I eventually quit and moved on to jobs that were a better fit for me. But there are a few things I learned from that first job that went on to serve me in future job searches. 

You have to hustle to get a job. There are a handful of majors that have a  clear career path, but the rest of us are left to fend for ourselves. While you can always apply to open jobs listings online, it's rare for them to work out. You're much more likely to land a job you have a connection to. Networking is totally out of my comfort zone, but the only way I got that first job was through someone I knew. And when I left that job it was through another connection I had. Letting people in your network know you are looking for a job is almost always how it's done. 

Remember you are more than your job. When I was working at that first job it was hard for me to see my value outside of it. After all, I had searched for a job for two months before landing that one. This was the best I could do, right? It really wore on my self-worth. I eventually quit, and once I was in a role I liked it was much easier for me to see how my worth wasn't tied to my job. I think that's part of the reason why it was easy for me to walk away from my most recent job to stay home. It was a great place to work, but I've realized my job doesn't define me. 

Most people don't have their dream job. My title at that first job was "event coordinator" which sounded super glamorous and looked good on a resume, but the truth was I was unhappy. Social media only tells half the story, and while you might be envious of someone else's career there's usually a lot more going on behind the scenes. At the end of the day, even a good job is still a job. And every job has some boring, unglamorous side to it (at my latest job it was a tonne of emails and meetings). 

If I could do it over again... 
Now that I'm a bit older I can see that very few people have their careers completely figured out. Most people are still working on it and aren't entirely sure what they want to be when they "grow up." The advice I gave my sister is to get on LinkedIn and find people who have your dream job. Where did they get their start? Apply for that job. And start making connections with people you'd like to work with. Find an email address, reach out to them, and pitch yourself. Or at least set up a time to chat about what they do. People won't know what you can bring to the table if they don't know you exist. 

How did you land your first job after college? Did you have a clear idea of what you wanted to do? Any advice you'd share with new grads?
