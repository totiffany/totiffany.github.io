  The idea of living in a city, and raising a kid here no less, can be confusing
  for some people. I get it. I grew up in a beautiful suburban neighborhood in
  Idaho. And I would agree that in a lot of ways raising a kid in suburbia is
  easier than it is in a city. But I also think life is better when you love
  where you live. I walk through this city pushing Hazel in her stroller every
  day, and if I spent that time focused on all the things I dislike about it I
  would be miserable. I don't want to live like that. I know we are lucky to be
  here, and I would rather enjoy it while it lasts.

One of the first questions we get when someone learns we live in San Francisco is, "Do you like it?"

The idea of living in a city, and raising a kid here no less, can be confusing for some people. I get it. I grew up in a beautiful suburban neighborhood in Idaho. And I would agree that in a lot of ways raising a kid in suburbia is easier than it is in a city. But I also think life is better when you love where you live. I walk through this city pushing Hazel in her stroller every day, and if I spent that time focused on all the things I dislike about it I would be miserable. I don't want to live like that. I know we are lucky to be here, and I would rather enjoy it while it lasts.

I often think about a family vacation we took to San Francisco when I was 12. I remember looking around at all the unique Victorian homes and thinking, "I would love to live here someday." And now I do! How cool is that? To this day, the beautiful architecture throughout this city is a pretty constant reminder of how incredible it is that we get to live here. I've been trying to [take more photographs of it lately](https://www.instagram.com/totiffany/), because I know I'm going to miss it like crazy someday when we move away. 

So the short answer is yes, we do like living here. But that doesn't mean there aren't things we don't like about it. The truth is, city life is hard. Especially with a kid. I think after being in a place for a while you can kind of get used to a lot of the inconveniences, but there are some things I will never not complain about. 

So today I thought I would list out the best and worst things about living in San Francisco. We'll start with the worst stuff and then end things on a good note. 

The 3 Worst Things About Living in San Francisco: 

1. The transportation. To really get around here you have to drive or take the bus. Driving is nerve-wracking. There are lots of pedestrians, one-way streets, and limited parking spots. The busses are notoriously slow, unreliable, stuffy, and they don't regulate if you've paid your fare or not. That means pretty much anyone can, and does, ride it. I've rubbed shoulders with some pretty strange people on those busses, which was fine when it was just me, but now that I have a baby and a stroller, it's not ideal. Not to mention getting on and off a bus with a stroller takes a huge amount of effort. Fortunately, most people I've ridden with have been nice about the whole thing, but you occasionally get some glares (strollers do take up a lot of room), and it makes me miss the days when I could throw everything in a car and just drive to a destination with a huge parking lot. 

2. The cost of living. Guys. It is so, so bad. I've talked a lot about that tiny studio apartment we first moved into here, and I can't even tell you how much we were paying for that place or you will be disgusted. Let's just say if you want to feel good about what you are paying for your rent/mortgage take a look at Craigslist listings for San Francisco apartments sometime. 

3. The poop. Yes, I mean actual poop. I hate that this is even a thing, but [we have a poop problem in San Francisco](http://time.com/5368610/san-francisco-poop-patrol-problem/). This city has one of the largest homeless populations in the country, and that means there’s a lot of poop on our sidewalks. You’ll just be casually walking down the street and oh no look out for the poop! It's horrible and makes me feel bad for unsuspecting tourists. Hey there welcome to America. There's garbage everywhere and we have poop on our sidewalks. 

The 3 Best Things About Living in San Francisco: 

1. The weather. I know this sounds like a boring one, but when Brian and I were considering where we wanted to move to the weather was actually a big factor. We spent a summer in NYC and loved our time there, but the blazing heat just about killed us. In my mind San Francisco weather is perfect. It’s perpetually late fall/early spring which is my favorite time of year. No harsh winters, no miserably hot summers. We can be outside year round. Now when we visit other places that have extreme weather (aka anywhere but here!) I'm a complete wimp. 

2. The food. San Franciscans care about what they eat. My kind of people. The best Indian food I’ve had in my life is from this tiny hole-in-the-wall place right down the hill from our apartment. Sometimes I actually think about how much I'll miss that place whenever we end up moving. There’s incredible sushi, sandwiches, and burgers throughout the city. And the burritos! Burritos are a big deal here, and they do them so, so well. Also my one true love, bakeries. There are so many delicious french bakeries here, and I won't ever get enough of them. I'm also always impressed by the variety of food that's available. I'd never tried Ethiopian food until I moved here, and now I'm hooked. 

3. The resources. Basically, if you want something, you can find it here. Given the tech hub that it is we have apps for food delivery, cleaning services, laundry, and transit. If you're into the arts we have broadway shows, the ballet, an opera house, and an orchestra. We went to see The Nutcracker last Christmas and it was downright magical. The sets and level of talent were mind-blowing. San Franciscans are also super into fitness, and you can find every kind of fitness class under the sun here. When I wanted to try spinning I was able to find a studio just a short walk from my apartment. We also have a free community college. Lots of my favorite brands have flagship stores here (Gap, Old Navy, Levis, Madewell). The parks and playgrounds are wonderful. Fun fact: Golden Gate Park is the biggest park in the United States! We have incredible museums and huge craft fairs. It’s not a bad place to be.
