My heart is hurting this week for all of the children who are being separated from their parents at the U.S. and Mexico border. I normally like to write about lighter, uplifting topics, but it would feel remiss not to discuss this. A big part of what I write about is motherhood and my own relationship with my daughter, and thinking about what these families are going through is devastating to me. I'd like to use what little influence I have to shed some light on the situation. 

First a bit of background. The majority of people crossing the border are seeking asylum from gang and cartel violence. In most cases, the situation at home is so dangerous, fleeing to the United States to seek asylum is the only option. Aslym means the right to live in a country for people who have to leave their native country as a refugee. 

If you step onto U.S. soil you have the right to seek asylum, but the Trump Administration has enacted a "zero-tolerance" policy against people crossing the border. This means everyone gets prosecuted for illegal entry. In this process, parents are being taken to federal court and their children are taken from them.

Between October 2017 and May 2018, at least 2,700 children have been split from their parents at the border. 1,995 of them were separated over just the last six weeks of that window. This means an average of 45 children are being taken from their parents each day. 

It's every parent's worst nightmare. Meg Conley, writer and mother of 3 articulated it perfectly. 

"Have you ever lost your child for just a moment? Around the corner in a grocery store? Or in a little crowd of people in a big place? You know that panicked feeling? The one that thickens your throat and pulses in your fingertips? The one you’re feeling as you call out your child’s name over and over again. Louder and louder until finally their head bobs up near the oranges, or their hand grabs yours from behind? Imagine that feeling. For months. In a place you cannot leave, where you cannot easily access a phone and you do not speak the language."

There must be a solution that allows for more compassion, we cried. Families must stay together. Children need their parents. 

The public's outrage finally pushed the president to sign an executive order yesterday. It specifies that families can be held together in immigrant detention centers as their cases are being processed. It was a relief, and a step in the right direction, but there is still much to be done. 

Everyone seeking asylum will still be prosecuted. Thousands of children need to be reunited with their parents.
