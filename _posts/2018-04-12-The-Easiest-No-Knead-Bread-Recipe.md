Today I'm sharing my absolute favorite bread recipe. I know baking bread can be intimidating, but trust me, you can make this. I love to bake, but I'm a lazy breadmaker. This recipe is super forgiving, there's no complicated ingredients, special equipment, or kneading required, and in the end, it creates a beautiful, golden loaf of bread that will have you feeling like you could open your own bakery. 

The original recipe for this bread came from [The New York Times](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/11376-no-knead-bread), and I've adapted it a bit to make it even easier. The only thing it requires is time, as you have to let the dough rise overnight. A couple of other notes before you get started... 

You don't need a cast iron pot. I finally purchased [this one from IKEA](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/90232840/) a few years ago specifically for making bread, but before that, I used our stainless steel soup pot. You can use anything that has a lid and can take the heat. 

You also don't need a baking sheet. I've just found it's easier, and less messy, to move the dough into the pot with a baking sheet underneath it. The dough will not stick to the bottom of your pan without it, but you will have to toss the dough into the hot pot. 

Don't worry about your dough looking like a perfect ball before you put it in the oven. You want there to be some texture at the top so it can crack open. I like to drop the dough onto my baking sheet and then fold four corners up towards the top to create a ball. 

Ok here we go. I'm so excited for you to try this. There are few things as good as homemade bread. It will make your house smell amazing and it tastes incredible. Golden brown and crusty on the outside, chewy on the inside – Your friends will be so impressed! Unless you want to keep it all for yourself. I would understand. 

Ingredients: 
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 tsp yeast
- 1 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 3/4 cups water

Directions:
In a large bowl, mix flour, yeast and salt. Add the water, and stir with your hand until just mixed (remember – no kneading!). The dough should be very sticky and shaggy. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rise overnight (12-18 hours). Heat oven to 450 degrees. Place a cast iron pot with lid in the oven and heat for 30 minutes. In the meantime, pour dough onto a floured baking sheet. Lightly pat the dough with some flour and create a ball. Remove the pot from the oven. Lift the dough and baking sheet into the hot pan. Bake covered for 30 minutes. Then remove the lid and cook for another 10-15 minutes to get the outside golden and crispy. That's it! Pat yourself on the back for being such a talented bread maker.

Please let me know if you make this recipe and how it turns out for you!
