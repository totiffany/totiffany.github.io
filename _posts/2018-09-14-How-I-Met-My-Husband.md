Seeing as how it's our anniversary month I thought it might be fun to share the story of how Brian and I met. I remember having this idea of how it would feel to fall in love and find the person I wanted to marry long before I met Brian, and it turned out to be quite different from what I expected. I thought it would be a whirlwind, lots of butterflies, love at first sight type stuff, but instead, it was much more gradual.

I only vaguely remember meeting Brian for the first time. He came over with a friend to my apartment (his friend knew my roommate). But I was so tired that night we only talked for a few minutes before I went back to bed. Neither of us really remember the conversation, but Brian does remember me not being very talkative and thinking I was a snob. Ha. 

A few days later I was walking by his apartment (which happened to be right behind the house I was living in) when he pulled up in his car. He got out and said he had met me the other day, but I had no memory of meeting him! I had been at his apartment complex the night before though where I had met a bunch of new people, so I figured I must have met him then. Nope. 

But in that moment, when I was fully awake and functional, we hit it off right away. I remember telling him I had just been reading an email from my brother who was serving his Mormon mission in Mexico. I can't really remember what else we talked about, but I do remember making him laugh. He was sweet and cute and goofy, and as I started walking back towards my house he asked for my number. 

A few days later we went on our first date. It was simple and casual, but the conversation came easily and I was struck by how comfortable I was around him. For our next date, he invited me to a songwriting night with friends. Brian is a genuinely talented guitar player and singer, and as you can imagine, this was rather charming. At one point he put his arm on the back of the couch we were sitting on to stretch, and I mistakenly thought he was putting his arm around me, so I leaned into him and that's how we ended up cuddling for the first time.

I don't remember how long after that we kissed for the first time, but right after it happened he asked me to be his girlfriend. I was pretty taken aback by that and took some time to give him an answer. I was used to guys playing games, and a guy being so clear about what he wanted was new and surprising for me. But that's just Brian's way. He was genuine and honest with me from day one. He was also patient, and it was only a matter of time before I warmed up to the idea of us being together. I will say, it's really easy to fall in love with someone who loves you like that.

On a similar note, Brian knew sooner than I did that he wanted to get married. It took me a bit longer to figure that one out. I knew I loved him, but I wasn't sure he was _the one_, yunno? Like I said I had all these ideas in my head of how falling in love would feel, and when it wasn't exactly that way I wasn't sure it was the right choice. 

When I was trying to make my mind up about it I tried to think about what would happen if we were to break up. I knew we would both eventually move on with our lives and find different people to love, but I realized I didn't like thinking about that. I hated the thought of him with someone else and me left wondering where life had taken him without me. Just because our love story didn't fit what I always imagined for myself didn't mean that it wasn't good, solid, real love. 

6 years later, and as you can probably gather, I'm really happy we decided to get married! Brian and I love spending time together, still never run out of things to talk about, and dream of working together in the future. Best of all we have a beautiful baby that we love and adore. Life is good. It is so very good. Here's to 6 wonderful years!
