When it comes to holiday gift giving I try to keep things simple. The key word being _try_. My recent read of [Simple Matters](https://redletterdayblog.com/Book-Review-5-Decluttering-Tips-From-Simple-Matters) has made me think more about giving gifts that are useful, edible, or experiences. So I'm trying to lean more that way, but it's really easy to get caught up in all the sales and shiny things this time of year and go over budget. 

One way I do manage to keep things simple â€“ Brian and I don't exchange Christmas gifts. I know that will sound crazy to some, but over the years we've found we just don't feel a need to exchange gifts. With all events and shopping and general craziness that comes in December, we don't need the extra stress that comes from finding each other the perfect gift. Instead, we exchange small gifts for birthdays and that works for us. So take that for what it's worth. 

For everyone else in my life I've put together a guide below with a few things I think might make good gifts. I've found it's always a little easier to shop for the women in my life. I can just buy them a bunch of my favorite things! Guys are tricker. 

I don't have a gift guide for kids listed here because honestly, at a year and a half, I don't think Hazel needs much. I let my parents know she loves airplanes, the moon, stars, books, and that we could always use more clothes for her, and called it good. She already has plenty of toys, and we have to make sure whatever she's given can fit in our suitcase on the flight home. So with all that said, let's get to it!  

For Him 

Food is always a great gift, and one of my favorite things to buy for friends and family each Christmas is chocolate bars from a local San Francisco shop called [Dandelion](https://store.dandelionchocolate.com/). They curate their cacao beans from all over the world, and the bars are labeled with which country the beans came from. I'm amazed at how different they all taste! 

On that note, I'll usually pop into local boutiques this time of year to see if they have any cute San Francisco themed gifts. I recently bought a friend a hand towel that had an illustration of a map of San Francisco. It's a fun, unique gift, and not something you could find anywhere else. 

One of the easiest (and most impressive) things to get Brian is a beautiful design book. [This one about Saul Bass](https://www.amazon.com/Saul-Bass-Life-Film-Design/dp/1856697525/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1544853640&sr=8-2&keywords=saul+bass+design) was his Christmas present a few years back, but I've been eyeing [this one about the worlds most influential creative directors](https://www.amazon.com/Eye-Influential-Creative-Directors-Develop/dp/1579658393/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1544853687&sr=8-3&keywords=the+eye) as well. 

A couple years back I bought my brother a [Hydroflask water bottle](https://www.amazon.com/Hydro-Flask-SYNCHKG098158-Standard-Pacific/dp/B01KXHF34W/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1544853713&sr=8-5&keywords=hydroflask) and now all my family members have one (#trendsetter). It doesn't sweat and keeps your drink cold or hot all day which is super handy. 

In the tech category [the Google Home Mini](https://store.google.com/us/product/google_home_mini?hl=en-US) is cute and practical, and I love the price point. 

It's pricier, but I love gifting tickets to a concert or class or something more on the experience side of things. For Father's Day this year I surprised Brian with tickets to Arcade Fire. It's something out of the ordinary and makes for a fun date night. 

Call me boring, but I always find that a nice pair of socks makes for a great gift. They're nice, practical, and will definitely get used. My favorite ones to get for the guys in my life are from [j.Crew Factory](https://factory.jcrew.com/c/mens-clothing/socks) or [Uniqlo](https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/men/socks-and-tights). 

For Her

Skincare is always a good bet. You know I love [Glossier](https://re.glossier.com/cbe15388), and their [face wash](https://www.glossier.com/products/milky-jelly-cleanser) and [rich moisturizer](https://www.glossier.com/products/priming-moisturizer-rich) are just the best. They also have some great [gift sets](https://www.glossier.com/category/sets) right now. On the more budget-friendly side of things, I love [this rosewater spray](https://www.ulta.com/facial-spray-with-aloe-herbs-rosewater?productId=xlsImpprod6200727) for a daily pick-me-up (I put it on first thing in the morning), and [this face oil](https://www.ulta.com/100-organic-nourishing-facial-oil?productId=xlsImpprod15381039) is one of my all-time favs. 

Books are a great option as well. I've gifted Gretchen Rubin's [The Happiness Project](https://www.amazon.com/Happiness-Project-Revised-Aristotle-Generally/dp/0062414852/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1544854231&sr=8-2&keywords=the+happiness+project) and [Better Than Before](https://www.amazon.com/Better-Than-Before-Habits-Procrastinate/dp/0385348630/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1544854255&sr=8-1&keywords=better+than+before) on several occasions, but you also can't go wrong with a great fiction read. For that, I love anything by Liane Moriarty ([What Alice Forgot](https://www.amazon.com/What-Alice-Forgot-Liane-Moriarty/dp/0425247449/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1544854282&sr=8-1&keywords=what+alice+forgot) and [Big Little Lies](https://www.amazon.com/Little-Lies-Liane-Moriarty-2014-07-29/dp/B01N07LGHU/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1544854301&sr=8-5&keywords=big+little+lies) are a couple of my favorites) and Celeste Ng ([Little Fires Everywhere](https://www.amazon.com/Little-Fires-Everywhere-Celeste-Ng/dp/0735224293/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1544854332&sr=8-1&keywords=little+fires+everywhere) and [Everything I Never Told You](https://www.amazon.com/Everything-I-Never-Told-You/dp/0143127551/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1544854356&sr=8-1&keywords=everything+I+never+told+you)). 

I think comfy loungewear is an excellent gift, and I'm obsessed with [the joggers from Gap](http://gap.com/browse/product.do?cid=38126&pcid=29504&vid=1&pid=388415012). They're incredibly soft, and if I'm at home, I'm wearing these. Clothing-wise I think the new [Universal Thread line at Target](https://www.target.com/c/universal-thread/-/N-rgtfe) is really cute. And anything from [Madewell](https://www.madewell.com/) is sure to be a hit. I love browsing their accessories section for gift ideas this time of year. 

I'm not big into jewelry these days, but my favorite Etsy shop for simple, minimal jewelry is [Mia & Mac](https://www.etsy.com/shop/miaandmac). I bought my sister one of [their initial necklaces](https://www.etsy.com/listing/467394026/12-in-14kt-gold-filled-initial-necklace?ga_search_query=initial&ref=shop_items_search_68) a few years ago and it's one of her favorites.
