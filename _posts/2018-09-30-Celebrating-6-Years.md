Six years. We got married 6 years ago. It feels like just yesterday, but then I think about all the things that have happened over the last 6 years and I can kind of believe it. We've lived in three states and five apartments. I've worked at three different companies. Brian has worked at four. And best of all, we had Hazel. 

On the day of our anniversary this year, Hazel and I were dancing when the song Unconditionally by Katy Perry came on. I don't normally have an emotional reaction to mainstream pop songs, but while I was singing along with the lyrics I almost started to cry. There's a line in the chorus that says, "There is no fear now. Let go and just be free. I will love you unconditionally." And I thought that is exactly how I feel about my marriage!

When I was single I often felt like I needed to impress or prove my value to other people, and I don't really feel that way anymore. Brian knows me. He's seen me on my good days and bad days. Sometimes I'm kind and sometimes I'm not. And he loves me anyway. I no longer live in fear of rejection. Brian loves me for who I am. He loves me completely. And there is something so freeing about being loved in that way. 

I've heard the first year of marriage is the hardest, but that wasn't true for us. The first year was a breeze. We were crazy in love and happy and broke, but bright-eyed and excited about our future. But time rolls on, life happens, and I'd say 2017 was our toughest year yet. I was pregnant, we moved, and then Hazel was born in April. All the while Brian was dealing with a painful foot injury, and near the end of the year I went back to work after my maternity leave. We were exhausted and short tempered. But even on our worst days I never worried about not being loved. I am loved. I am worthy of love. I have someone who cares about me at all times. It's a constant in my life. 

So how are we celebrating 6 years? With a family trip to NYC! We spent a summer there when we were first married and have been meaning to go back ever since. I've been planning everything and am so excited for all of us to spend some time together in that beautiful city. 

Here's to marriage and feeling loved! I'm excited to see what the next 6 years have in store for us and all the years after that.
