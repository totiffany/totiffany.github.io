Over the past couple weeks I've been going to a spinning class. I've been wanting to work off the last few pounds of baby weight and have been told there aren't really any negative effects to exercise, so I settled on spinning. I wanted to see what all the fuss is about. 

It's a 6am class, which we can all agree is an ungodly hour to be awake, let alone to be doing a workout, but I like that I can get it out of the way while Hazel is asleep and get home right around the time she wakes up. It means I don't miss out on any time with her and Brian. (It also means I have to take a nap later in the day when she does or I turn into a walking zombie, but yunno, give and take). 

So here's a story about the first time I went to the class. I leave my apartment at 5:30 in the morning (ew) and walk to the studio. After being handed some shoes for the class and showing me the lockers I'm on my own. I change my shoes, tuck away my stuff, and walk into class. 

I find a bike that seems... fine. I don't really know what I'm looking for, so I think this will do.  I want to be able to see the instructor, so I go for a bike on the front row. I hop on and see the other girls spinning away to warm up, so I do the same. 

The class starts. The lights dim to purple. The instructor plays some music with a lot of bass. She's shouting commands and telling us when to sit, when to stand, when to turn up the resistance. It's different and fun and I'm into it. My heart rate goes up. But here's the thing – NO ONE TOLD ME YOUR SHOES ARE SUPPOSED TO CLIP INTO THE PEDALS. I've never taken a spin class like this in my life, and I'm here by myself. So, naturally, my feet are flying off left and right. My feet can't possibly stay on with the kind of speed she's pushing for, and anytime I try to slow down I nearly fall off the bike. I look around and wonder how anyone else is managing all this MOVEMENT and keeping their feet in place. 

Finally around 15 minutes into class, after seeing how much I've been struggling front and center, the instructor actually gets off her bike and walks over to me. She asks me something I can't really hear. Then she kneels down grabs my foot, puts it in place, and I feel a CLICK. OH. I think. DUH. Then I snap my other foot in and enjoyed the rest of class. 

I thought about that experience all day. I felt mortified that the instructor had to stop what she was doing to come to help me. But then I realized that no one else in the room probably gave it a second thought. I don't know about you, but when I'm working out I'm only worried about myself. How I'm feeling, and if I'm doing everything right. 

Plus, I told myself, I did the damn thing. I tried something new. I got a great workout in while my husband and baby were asleep. And it was enough to get me to book that class again a week later.

I've been re-reading one of my favorite books The Compound Effect lately. It's a quick, easy, motivational read, but the overarching theme is small change + time = big change. Everyone craves the big changes in their lives; wanting to lose the weight, write a book, travel the world, but few of us are willing to really put in the TIME it takes to achieve those things. To take the small, unsexy steps towards reaching our goals over a long period of time. Sometimes years.  

For me, taking those first steps are usually the hardest, so I tap out before I've even begun. But I'm finally getting to a point where I'm not afraid to try new things. So what if I don't know what I'm doing? So what if I need some help? It's easy to forget the hard work and time that goes into someone reaching their goals when all we see (and envy) is the results, but everyone had to start somewhere. 

Brian is a great example of this to me. When I look at him I see tons of talent. He's an incredible designer, guitar player, and budding programmer (he built this blog for me from scratch). But he has had to remind me on multiple occasions that getting to where he is took TONS of time and effort. Hours watching design program tutorials, hours holed up in his room learning guitar. He's just so persistent and hard working that now, years later, his skills seem effortless. 

What about you? Got any big goals you're working towards? If you’re still in the unsexy, struggling, slow-going phase let's cheer each other on. Small changes + time = big change.
