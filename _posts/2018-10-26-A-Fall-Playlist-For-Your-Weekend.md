Fancy seeing you here. In a pumpkin patch in October. How very unexpected. 

Apologies I've been a bit quiet on the blog this month. I'll be honest I've been feeling overwhelmed lately. As you can probably tell from the tone of my last post, this new stage with Hazel is a tough one, and it's wearing on me. Most days I feel like I can't get anything done and when I try to she often ends up yelling at me. It's hard.
