Fancy seeing you here. In a pumpkin patch in October. How very unexpected. 

I know it was pretty quiet on the blog this past month. I'll be honest I've been feeling overwhelmed lately. As you can probably tell from the tone of my last post, this new stage with Hazel is a tough one, and it's wearing on me. Most days I feel like I can't get anything done and when I try to she often ends up yelling at me. She's at that transition point where she's trying so hard to be independent, but still very much a baby. She wants me to watch her play 

However, over the past couple days there have been a few moments where she plays on her own and gives me a few minutes to myself. I feel like it's a glimse into my future when she can actually entertain herself without needing me to watch her.
