Fancy seeing you here. In a pumpkin patch in October. How very unexpected. 

I know I've been pretty quiet on the blog this past month. I'll be honest I've been feeling a little overwhelmed lately. As you can probably tell from the tone of my last post, this new stage with Hazel is a tough one, and it's wearing on me. Most days I feel like I can't get anything done, and whenever I try she usually yells at me demanding my full attention. It doesn't even have to be something productive. She even won't let me go to the bathroom without pounding at the door and loudly protesting that I come back out. She's at that transition where she's trying so hard to be independent, but still very much my baby. She wants to be at my side most of the day, and as much as I love her, it can be mind-numbing and exhausting to keep her entertained all day. 

However, over the past couple days there have been a few moments where she played quietly on her own and gave me a few minutes to myself. It felt like a glimpse into my future when she will actually entertain herself without needing me to watch her constantly. That's actually what I remember most from my childhood – Playing with my brother and sister all day without really knowing or caring where my mom was. But these are the early years, and the early years are more demanding. I get that. But that doesn't make it any less hard. 

Thankfully, the tough moments are mixed with Hazel being so, so cute and entertaining. She has developed a few words and whenever she says one just right I'm amazed at how bright she is. She's also finally caught onto the sign language we've been teaching her, and loves to point out airplanes and stars and birds in real life and in all of her books. Sometimes I stare at her face and her head full of curls, and am so amazed by how beautiful she is that I can't believe she's real. 

And October really wasn't all bad. Shortly after we got back from New York my oldest friend Cassie came to visit us from Texas. I loved showing her around the city and introducing her to my favorite pastry – the kouign-amann from b. patisserie bakery. I also happened to have tickets to the musical Waitress the weekend she was in town, and Brian was happy to let her go in his place. It was wonderful. I laughed, I cried. And the music was all written by Sara Barellis whom I'm a massive fan of.

Our church's Halloween party was this past weekend and we dressed up as San Francisco's favorite 24-hour donut shop, Bob's Donuts. Hazel was a donut and we were Bob's employees. I wanted to do a family costume and had a stroke of inspiration when I saw a family dressed up as Krispy Kreme donuts on Pinterest. Everyone here knows Bob's, and I knew we could put a local spin on it. To pull it off we had to get the logo exactly right, but thanks to Brian's design skills and a friend's cricut machine, it ended up looking so good we had several people asking us if we actually got our aprons from Bob's. And Hazel tolerated her costume long enough for us to get a few cute pictures and to go trick-or-treating at the church. 

But back to the actual title of this blog post. I think the excitment for fall starts to wane a bit in November (for me anyway, I'm already excited for Christmas), but I wanted to share a fall playlist I've been putting together. We've been listening to it a lot this past month while burning my pumpkin clove scented candle and it makes everything feel extra cozy. Enjoy!
