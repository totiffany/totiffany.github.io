  In 2016 I discovered capsule wardrobes and fell hard and fast for the idea of
  a streamlined closet. If you're not familiar with capsule wardrobes, it's
  essentially a mini wardrobe of clothes you love to wear. There are a few rules
  to follow. 1. You try to stick to a limited number of items (around 30-40),
  which includes tops, bottoms, dresses, outerwear, and shoes. 2. You wear only
  those items for 3 months. 3. You avoid going shopping until it's time to put
  together next season's capsule.

In 2016 I discovered capsule wardrobes and fell hard and fast for the idea of a streamlined closet. If you're not familiar with capsule wardrobes, it's essentially a mini wardrobe of clothes you love to wear. There are a few rules to follow. 1. You stick to a limited number of items (around 30-40), which includes tops, bottoms, dresses, outerwear, and shoes. 2. You wear only those items for 3 months. 3. You avoid going shopping until it's time to put together next season's capsule. 

I found inspiration in [Project 333](https://bemorewithless.com/project-333/) and the blog [Un-Fancy](http://www.un-fancy.com), and loved the minimalist approach to tackling your closet. But after attempting a capsule wardrobe, and failing at it few times, I've decided a strict capsule isn't for me. Here's why. 

**For starters, we don't really have seasons in San Francisco.** We're lucky to have temperate weather year round with a few exceptions. This means compiling mini wardrobes for each season just isn't realistic. There's not enough variety in the weather for me to justify it. I also learned a capsule wardrobe doesn't always account for unexpected weather. I like to have access to my sandals as well as my rain boots at all times, just in case.  

**I don't have a ton of storage.** With a capsule wardrobe, ideally you only keep the items you are currently wearing on display and box up the rest. It pushes you to be creative with the limited number of clothes you have available. The thing is, we're in a one-bedroom apartment and I don't have the luxury of storing the majority of my clothes. The best use of space is to have all of them available in the closet I use daily.

**I have yet to see someone tackle capsule wardrobes for pregnancy.** My wardrobe during pregnancy was a hodge-podge of clothes I already owned that I could squeeze into plus a handful of maternity items I purchased. It was a mess, but that's just how it was. You wear what fits. Post-partum was a whole other issue. I remember walking into my closet a few days after Hazel was born and staring at my clothes for a good 5 minutes wondering what on earth I could actually wear. It had to be comfortable, loose, and nursing friendly. Not even my favorite pair of jeans fit the bill! As a new mother, your body is constantly changing, and I liked keeping all my clothes available to choose from. Sometimes an item wouldn't fit one day but would the next. If you find a creative way to tackle this one please share! 

For me, the big takeaway with attempting a capsule wardrobe was to create a wardrobe that is small and full of pieces I love and actually wear. Interestingly, Caroline at Un-Fancy [doesn't stick to a strict capsule anymore either](http://www.un-fancy.com/about/). The rules and numbers weren't for me, but attempting it did help me give a lot more thought to my clothing purchases.  I still like to shop, but I've learned I can be happy with a lot less. I feel much more satisfied with my closet.
