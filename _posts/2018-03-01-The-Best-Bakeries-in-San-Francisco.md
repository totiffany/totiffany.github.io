San Franciscans love their food, and bakeries are no exception. After we moved here I was thrilled to discover the variety of bakery options available. I truly believe a perfectly flaky, buttery pastry can be life-changing. Now anytime someone comes to visit us we take them to at least one of our favorite bakeries, and now I'm sharing the goodness with all of you! 

**b. patisserie** 
My absolute favorite bakery in the city. Everything here is delicious, but the best thing on the menu is the traditional kouign aman. It's unassuming compared alongside the other pastries, but it's simply the best. The chocolate banana almond croissant is also wonderful and their hot chocolate comes in a cup the size of a small bowl.  

**Mr. Holmes Bakehouse**
Home of the famous cruffin – A half muffin, half croissant creation with a delightful cream filling that comes in a different flavor every day. There are plenty of other baked goods to choose from, but the cruffin and donuts (which also change flavors daily) really are the best. Be sure to go early in the week to avoid a long line. No seating is available, but the hot pink neon sign inside and beautiful pastry boxes make for great pictures. 

**Arsicault**
Arsicault was named the best new bakery in America in 2016 by food magazine Bon Appetit, and their pastries have been in high demand ever since. If you happen to be in the Richmond neighborhood, you must make a stop here. It's a tiny place with a simple menu; a few different croissants, a kouign aman, and morning buns, but everything is excellent. They stay open until everything sells out for the day. 

**Bob’s Donuts**
Bob's is a hole-in-the-wall donut shop that's open 24 hours a day. I'll be honest, I wasn't impressed the first couple times I tried this place, but I've since found my favorite donut – a traditional glazed old-fashioned. Once the man working behind the counter told me it was his favorite as well. And you can never go wrong with asking for whatever is coming hot out of the oven. 

**Tartine**
I have to include Tartine on the list because it's one of the most well-known bakeries in San Francisco, but personally, I prefer b. patisserie or Arsicault.  If you really want to go their morning bun is out-of-this-world good and their sourdough really is delicious.
