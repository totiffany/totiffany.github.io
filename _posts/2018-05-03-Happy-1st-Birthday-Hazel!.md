I can't believe our little Hazel is 1! I know every parent says this, but oh my goodness where did the time go?? Sometimes I miss that squishy newborn stage, but every month with her brings new joys to our lives. Here are a few things I want to remember at this age... 

Hazel is a light everywhere she goes. The comment we get the most from strangers is, "She's so smiley!" She has an easy, big, contagious smile she shares with everyone. 

Her favorite toys right now are her red rubber ball and the new xylophone she got for her birthday. She chases that ball all over our apartment and gets a big smile on her face whenever she sees it. I was so impressed how easily she figured out the xylophone after I gave it to her. I guess babies just naturally want to wack things.

Her favorite activity is playing hide and seek with Brian. It's more Brian hiding and popping out to surprise her, but she squeals with excitement every time he does it. She loves books too and will sit in my lap patiently as I read book after book to her. And she loves music. She's always been mesmerized by her dad playing the guitar, and now she likes to try strumming it herself. 

She crawls super fast and pulls herself up on everything. She can walk as long as she's holding onto something, but doesn't show a lot of interest in walking on her own.

The sound she makes the most is "Buh" and we think it's because all of her favorite things start with the letter "B" â€“ Ball, bottle, and binky. Aside from that, she says "Ma" occasionally for mama. Brian is jealous, but I know who the real favorite is. 

She LOVES to eat. And will eat anything we put in front of her (Except that cake! We made it just for her to smash it, but she was content to just pick the sprinkles off the top and eat those). She's started to get very vocal at the dinner table when she wants more food. It seems like she will eat all day. I never know if I'm giving her enough.

She sleeps well at night but continues to hate naps. She'll take them, but only after loudly protesting for at least 30 minutes. She's probably a little too reliant on her binky, but it helps her sleep, so we're certainly not taking it away anytime soon. 

I really can't believe it's been an entire year since we were in the hospital holding her for the first time. I had a very long labor and was so exhausted by the time she was born that the strongest emotion I felt after meeting her was relief. I was just so relieved it was over and that she was finally here and ok. But over the next few hours and days, I came to know she and I were connected and that she knew who I was. It's crazy. This much love. It feels like my heart has cracked open and will never be the same. 

We love you so much Hazel! Happy first birthday baby girl!
