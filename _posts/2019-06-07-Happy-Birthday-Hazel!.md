Before the baby comes I wanted to be sure to write about our little Hazel turning 2! Her birthday was at the end of April, so this post is only over a month late. Ha. I had big plans that day to throw a party for her with a few of our closest friends and family. But she woke up sick and and refused to nap, so we canceled our plans and went for a drive around the city instead. Thankfully she always falls asleep on long drives. 

Here are a few updates on my baby girl who I can't believe is 2... 

Hazel has the sweetest spirit that reminds me so much of Brian. She's incredibly observant and bright, but also cautious and particular. She seems to get easily overwhelmed by noisy and new environments (I suspect she and Brian are both highly sensitive, but I'm planning to read the book to know for sure). But when she's feeling comfortable she's silly and loves to make us laugh, so there's a bit of me in there too. Overall she's her own little person, and we are loving to get to know her personality as she transitions from being our baby to being a little girl. 

She understands a lot of what we say and communicates really well in her own little made up language. It's a combination of real words, sounds, and sign language. She's not saying as many real words as I would like, and we suspect it's because we can usually tell what she's trying to say, so she doesn't feel a need to talk. I'm trying my very best not to worry about it. She'll figure it out soon. She did learn the word "no" recently, and for a while the answer to every question was "no." Thankfully, she also just learned the words "yes" and "yeah" so her answers are becoming more accurate. 

She's gotten pickier about food as she's gotten older, but usually if I can get her to try something once she'll take several bites. She loves pasta and ice cream best, but mostly her diet consists of a whole lot of fruit and dairy. Veggies are more touch and go (except peas. She loves peas), but occasionally she'll surprise me and eat a bunch of them. I keep trying to offer her a variety of food, and she'll usually try a bit of whatever we're eating.

She is obsessed with her baby doll right now, and I'm really hoping that translates to her loving the actual baby that's headed our way. She's very sweet with it and likes to pat him, rock him, and push him around in her baby stroller. In many ways the baby has become an extension of her. If she bumps her head, baby also bumps his head and needs to be comforted. After we change her diaper, baby's diaper needs to be changed too. It's a little silly and over the top, but we're rolling with it. 

Aside from her baby doll she loves airplanes and helicopters and motorcycles, but also loves to wear dresses and her sparkly jelly shoes. I'm trying to not influence her likes and dislikes too much and just let her gravitate towards whatever appeals to her. She has loved to sing since before she could talk, and can now sing several of the songs we've taught her right on key. She still loves music, but has become particular about which types of songs she likes to dance to. The Beach Boys are typcially what we're listening to these days.

It feels like she has been sick nonstop since December, and when I told her pediatrician that she just said, "Yup. Sounds about right." It turns out toddlers are sick A LOT. Unfortunately, when Hazel is sick she tends to lose her appetite and doesn't sleep super well, so after months of that Brian and I are feeling tired and pretty worn out. She'll get better for a few days, and then right when I think we're in the clear she'll wake up congested again. It's been rough. 

She continues to be super attached to me, which is getting harder and harder as we near the end of my pregnancy. I know it's just a stage, this too shall pass, etc. but man is it hard right now. Just the other day you would have thought the 15 minutes I spent getting ready in the bathroom were the end of the world. She pounded on the door and wailed and cried until I came out. Brian, bless him, continues to try and give me a break, but she often refuses to go to him. Its been hard for all of us, and I just keep hoping with time she'll chill out a bit. 

She looks really similar to me at her age, but I see a lot of Brian in there too. They both have the bluest eyes, but Hazel's have a tiny rim of brown around the center that is unique to her. Her hair is super curly, and we're all obsessed with it. She's also really tall for her age, so people frequently mistake her for being older than she is. 

She is our little ray of sunshine, and even though my days with her are a struggle lately as I try to keep up with all her energy in my very pregnant state, we love her to pieces. I know they say "terrible twos," but I actually feel like we have a lot to look forward to in the coming year with her as she learns to communicate more, becomes more independent, and gets to that sweet spot where she can really enjoy all the things that childhood has to offer (zoos, aquariums, parks, playgrounds, etc.) 

We love you Hazel girl! We feel incredibly lucky to know you and be your parents!
