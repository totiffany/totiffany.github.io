  Keeping on the theme of mine and Brian's anniversary coming up, today I want
  to talk about engagement rings. Have you ever thought about why we expect a
  diamond ring when a guy proposes? It wasn't until after I got married that I
  learned that engagement rings, as we know them today, are a fairly recent
  phenomenon. Before that, I didn't give it a second thought. When a guy
  proposes you get a ring. Your friends and family ooh and ahh over it. That's
  the way it's done, right? Well, here's a little about where that tradition

Keeping on the theme of mine and Brian's anniversary coming up, today I want to talk about engagement rings. Have you ever thought about why we expect a diamond ring when a guy proposes? It wasn't until after I got married that I learned that engagement rings, as we know them today, are a fairly recent phenomenon. Before that, I didn't give it a second thought. When a guy proposes you get a ring. Your friends and family ooh and ahh over it. That's the way it's done, right? Well, here's a little about where that tradition comes from...

While wedding bands have been around for a while (historians believe ancient Egyptians started the tradition which is pretty neat), diamond rings didn't really become the standard until the 1930's. The 30's! That really wasn't that long ago. At that time premarital sex was still considered a no-no, but it was becoming more acceptable to sleep with your fiancé once you were engaged. But if for whatever reason the engagement got broken off, the woman was considered blemished to other suitors. In other words, her market value had gone down (insert eye roll here). 

If an engagement did get broken off several states had laws that allowed women to sue for "breach of promise to marry." Suing ensured she would be ok financially for a while, but the laws were starting to be done away with. Which raised the question, if a woman couldn't sue what could she do to protect herself?

Well, it's hard to imagine now, but at that time there happened to be an influx of diamonds in the diamond industry. Seeing an opportunity, the De Beers diamond company launched a campaign to boost sales. Their advertising agencies got a few celebrities to wear flashy rings on the red carpet and movies soon featured engagement scenes with diamond rings. The idea caught on pretty quickly – A guy gives a girl an expensive ring (which does have a romantic charm to it), and she has something of value she can keep if he breaks up with her. 

It's a fascinating story, but after I learned it I felt duped. The only reason I felt I needed a diamond was because an advertising agency from decades ago made me feel that way! Why didn't I question where this tradition before I got married?? In today's culture, it's sort of ridiculous to think a man would need a way to ensure his fiancé won't be ruined by having sex with him. But that's essentially the reason why we expect a diamond ring when a guy pops the question.

I do feel fortunate that Brian didn't spend an extravagant amount on my ring. It was a lot for us at the time, but we were poor college students. My ring is simple, but I like that it represents where we were at in our lives when we bought it. For some reason, the oval + halo + plain band combination I wanted was surprisingly hard to find, so Brian ended up drawing a sketch of it and had it custom made. Which makes me like it even more. 

I still like wedding rings for a few practical reasons. It's a symbol, universally understood, that lets people know you're committed to someone else. I also like that when I look at my ring it reminds me of Brian and our history together. But knowing what I know now, I would have been alright if we had saved the money or had done something else with it. I could have used a ring I already owned for my engagement ring or chosen a less-expensive, non-traditional stone.

One tradition we did forgo – The wedding band. I didn't feel a need to wear two rings when one does the job just fine. And I certainly didn't want to pay more for it. 

So now I'm curious – Does knowing more about the history of engagement rings make you feel differently about it? Did you forgo tradition and do your own thing for your engagement ring?
