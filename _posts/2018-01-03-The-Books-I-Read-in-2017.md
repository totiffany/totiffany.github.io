What Alice Forgot

The Curly Girl Handbook. Early last year I put out a call on Facebook for help with my curls. Lots of great products were recommended, as was this book. 

Scrappy Little Nobody

Abandon. I almost didn't put this one on the list because it's not the most I was a big Meg Cabot fan in high school and so when the opportunity came a few years ago to go to a book signing with her I couln't pass it up. This was the book she was on tour for at the time and it took me about 5 years to get around to reading it. It was... fine. Not great. It's a modern retelling of the Greek myth of Persephonie. 

The Unfortunate Importance of Beauty. The book starts out nice enough 

The Happiness Project. I re-read this one shortly after Hazel was born. 

A Curious Mind

Cinderella Ate My Daughter 

When Breath Becomes Air

Solve Your Child's Sleep Problems. Not the most exciting read, but this book was recommended to me when we started running into sleeping issues with Hazel, and it seriously changed our lives. It's dense, and I must admit I didn't read the entire thing, but the sections on getting your child to sleep at night and getting on a nap schedule worked for us. It was a tough week, but now Hazel sleeps through the night and is getting into a good nap routine.
