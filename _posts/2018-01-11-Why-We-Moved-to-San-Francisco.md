Since moving to San Francisco we get a lot of questions about what exactly we're doing out here. So to kick this blog off, and bring everyone up to date, I thought I'd answer a few of the most common questions we get about living in the city.

While city life isn't for everyone, we love the life we've built here – Our San Francisco baby, our apartment, our jobs, and dinners with friends (who don't mind we can't stay out _too_ late anymore because bedtime is a thing now). Life is good! And we're trying to enjoy every second of it.

**Why did you move to San Francisco?** The short answer is, we wanted to. We knew the best thing for Brian’s career would be to do the city thing for a while. So for us that meant San Francisco, LA, or New York. We liked the weather in San Francisco and the proximity to our families in Idaho, so we decided to live here. It helped that my job also has an office in the city I was able to transfer to from Utah.

**What are you doing there?** Brian works as a product designer at [Nerd Wallet](https://www.nerdwallet.com/), designing screens for their website and mobile app. I went back to work in October after a nice maternity leave with Adobe. I help create content for [Adobe's blog](https://theblog.adobe.com/).

**How long have you been living there?** Three years. Time flies.

**How long do you plan on staying?** We don’t really know. As long as we want to I guess? We’d like to own a home someday, and at this point we can’t really imagine being able to afford one here. So we’ll move eventually. Just not right now.

**Where do you live in the city?** Right in the heart of it. Lower Nob Hill if you’re familiar with the neighborhoods. In considering where we wanted to be in our latest move we looked at apartments all over the city and the east bay, but ultimately decided we like our current neighborhood best. It's fairly close to work for both of us which keeps our commutes short.

**How big is your apartment?** We recently moved from a studio to a one bedroom apartment. We found it a couple months before Hazel was born and were so happy to find a bigger place just in time for her arrival. By San Francisco standards it’s pretty spacious with a few good closets (a luxury!), but by Idaho and Utah standards, where were from, it’s small. Our old studio apartment was tiny – Only 311 square feet – so we’re easy to please!

**But where does the baby sleep in a one bedroom apartment?** She recently moved from a bassinet in our room to a mini crib in a closet. That’s pretty standard for the city. Thankfully babies don't need a lot of room.

**Do you have a car in the city?** We don't own a car right now. We didn't want to deal with expensive parking fees and potential break ins that come with having a car here. To get around we walk, take the buss, or use Lyft and Uber. It's proving to be tougher with a baby, but we've gotten really good at quickly buckling in Hazel's car seat when we need to.

**How does grocery shopping work?** We do a mix of carrying our groceries home and getting them delivered to us. [Stroller hooks](https://www.amazon.com/Think-King-Stroller-Wheelchair-Rollator/dp/B002MXP3SM/ref=sr_1_7_s_it?s=baby-products&ie=UTF8&qid=1514784564&sr=1-7&keywords=stroller+hooks) have been a game changer. There is a Trader Joes just up the hill we use for most of our essentials and produce. For everything else we use a grocery delivery service. It's especially handy for heavy items like milk and flour.

**Isn’t it expensive to live there?** Yes! It’s ridiculously expensive. [San Franciscos is the most expensive place to live in the U.S. right now](http://time.com/money/4287132/most-expensive-cities-to-rent/). Fortunately we both work in tech and can make it work, but it still hurts to see that money disappear from our bank account each month.

**Do you like living there?** We do! We think cities are really fun and have fallen in love with this one. There are pros and cons to city living, but for now we’re enjoying the adventure. In our experience you can never run out of things to do here. The food is amazing, the museums are fantastic, and we've made some awesome friends. Whenever we cross over the Bay Bridge coming into the city I love seeing the skyline and the bay. It feels like home.
