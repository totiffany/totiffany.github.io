In 2016 I discovered capsule wardrobes and fell hard and fast for the idea of a streamlined wardrobe. If you're not familiar with capsule wardrobes, it's essentially a mini wardrobe of clothes you love to wear each season. There's usually a specific number of items people try to stick to, around 30-40, which includes tops, pants, dresses, jackets, and shoes. 

I found inspiration in [Project 333](https://bemorewithless.com/project-333/) and Caroline Joy's blog [Un-Fancy](http://www.un-fancy.com), and loved their minimalist approach to tackling your closet. But after attempting a capsule wardrobe, and failing at it few times, I've decided a strict capsule wardrobe isn't for me. Here's why. 

For starters, we don't really have seasons in San Francisco. We're lucky to have temperate weather year round with a few exceptions. This means compiling mini wardrobes for each season just isn't realistic for me. And you never know when you're going to deal with unexpected weather. I like to have access to my sandals as well as my rain boots at all times.  

I don't have a ton of storage. With a capsule wardrobe, ideally you only keep the 30-40 items you are currently wearing on display and box up the rest. It forces you to be creative with the limited number of clothes you have out. The thing is, we're in a one-bedroom apartment and I don't have the luxury of storing the majority of my clothes. The best use of space is to have them available the closet I use daily.

I have yet to see someone tackle capsule wardrobes for pregnancy or post-partum. My wardrobe during pregnancy was a hodge-podge of clothes I already owned that I could squeeze into plus a handful of maternity items I purchased. It was a mess, but at the time I felt like that's just how it was. You wear what fits. And as for post-partum, I remember walking into my closet a few days after Hazel was born and just staring at my clothes for a good 5 minutes wondering what on earth I could actually wear. As a mother, your body is constantly changing, and I like keeping all my clothes available to choose from. If you find a creative way to tackle this one please share!

For me, the big takeaway with attempting a capsule wardrobe was to create a wardrobe that is small and full of pieces I love and actually wear. Interestingly, Caroline herself [doesn't stick to a strict capsule anymore either](http://www.un-fancy.com/about/). The rules and numbers weren't for me, but attempting it did help me give a lot more thought to my clothing purchases. And overall I feel much happier with my closet.
