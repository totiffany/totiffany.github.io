I feel fortunate to work for a company that offers a generous maternity leave. I was given 1 month off pre-baby and 5 months with baby. But despite the amount of time I had, as the end of leave approached I was having mixed feelings about going back to work. Was I really ready?

Ultimately, I decided I'd never know if being a working mom was something I wanted to do unless I gave it a go, and I chose to go back to work full-time. I considered asking if I could switch to part-time, but that would mean losing a lot of the benefits my job offers. Plus, in my experience part-time actually means full-time work for part-time pay, which isn't what I wanted.

Instead, I worked it out with my manager to have a flexible schedule where I work from home twice a week on Mondays and Fridays. Much of my job involves me sitting in front of a computer, which means I can do it from anywhere. It's a bit tricker with a baby, but I'm grateful for the flexibility.

The thing that helped me the most with the transition back was finding a nanny we trusted to take care of Hazel. A friend of ours happened to be available, and she lived just down the street from us. It was a temporary solution, as she was planning to move back home in December, but I decided I was ok with that. I knew the transition would be a lot easier if Hazel was with someone I knew and trusted.

I expected to hate going back. I had talked to a few friends who had been through this and they talked about how difficult it was. That made sense to me. After spending all your time with your baby wouldn't it feel terrible to leave? Would she really be ok without me?

The initial handoff of Hazel that first week was hard. It felt like I was literally handing over my heart and asking someone to please take care of it. But once I walked outside I felt much better. In fact, for a second it felt like nothing had changed. I was the same old me catching the bus on my way to work. But that wasn't true. Everything had changed! My world is completely different.

I've been back at work now for four months, and I'm surprised to say, I actually like it! Much more than I thought I would. I like having time that is my own again. When I'm in the office if I need to work, I work. If I want to go to lunch, I go to lunch. I enjoy being around adults and contributing to a team. And I don't feel as guilty about leaving Hazel as I thought I would. The nannies we've found so far have given me peace of mind.

That being said, it's not always easy. When things are slower at work it's tough for me to be there. I'd rather be at home with my baby. And with Brian and I both working again it's been difficult to keep up with the daily chores that go into running a home. The dishes pile up, the floor needs vacuumed, the trash needs taken out. Meal planning has essentially gone out the window. We've been eating a lot of takeout and deli sandwiches. Our time is definitely more limited.

I'm not sure what the future holds for me as a working mom, but I've decided I always want to be doing _something_. We mamas need to take care of ourselves, and that means continuing to do things we enjoy after we have children â€“ Whether that's a job, a hobby, a class, whatever! That's part of the reason I started blogging again. Spending time doing something for myself gives me energy, and that helps me be a better mom.

Since becoming a mother I've realized this is something parents universally struggle with. We want to feel fulfilled and reach our own potential, and we need to provide for our families, but we also want to spend as much time as possible with our children. It's a tough balance!

So what say you working moms, stay at home moms, and future moms? How do you find that balance?
