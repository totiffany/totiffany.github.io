About every 6 months or so I pick up a new book to read about organizing and decluttering. Living in a one-bedroom apartment means space is limited, so I'm always looking for new tips on how to clear out and keep everything looking and feeling tidy. 

While some of the advice I've read over the years hasn't stuck (ahem... [capsule wardrobes](https://redletterdayblog.com/What-I-Learned-From-Trying-A-Capsule-Wardrobe)), I'd say most of the principals have improved our lives for the better. Keeping our apartment, even down to the closets, cleared out and organized actually makes me feel better. Which makes sense â€“ Studies have shown that more stuff causes us more stress, anxiety, and less happiness. Whereas having more order gives us more time and peace of mind.  

The latest book I read on the topic was, "Simple Matters" by Erin Boyle. Erin is a blogger at readingmytealeaves.com, and she lives in a one-bedroom apartment in New York City with her husband and daughter. Keeping things tidy in her own home is important to her too, and she likes everything she owns to be beautiful and serve a purpose. As with all of this genre of books, there are tips I'll take and tips that I don't think will work their way into my own lifestyle, but here are the ones that stuck with me. 

1.  On giving and accepting gifts. As Christmastime approaches this advice feels timely. Each year, Brian and I have to approach our wishlists thoughtfully. Not only do we not have a lot of space in our apartment for more stuff, but our gifts need to be able to fit in our luggage on the way home! Erin says when it comes to gift giving, you can't always control what gifts are given to you, but you can be an example when you give gifts. She says to, "... give gifts of the edible, usable, experiential variety that you might also hope to receive." 

2. On how to tackle family heirlooms. Family heirlooms and other sentimental items are some of the toughest to sort through, but I LOVED Erin's advice on this. She says when it comes to family heirlooms she likes to ask if the items are useful, lovely, or if they fill a void. If the answer is yes to all three, then you keep it. If not, you keep the memory and part with the object. I love the concept of family heirlooms serving a purpose in your home. If they're just sitting in a box never being used or even looked at, you may as well let them go. 

3. On what you need for a new baby. I remember when I was pregnant we were asking friends what we would need when the baby arrived and one wise friend told us, "You really don't need anything." It sounded crazy at the time, but Erin essentially gives the same advice. Things that make your life easier once you have a baby will really depend on the particulars of your baby. It's best to buy very little in advance and bring more things into your life, thoughtfully, as you need them. Plus the hospital sends you home with so. much. stuff. There's no reason to buy a large amount of diapers and wipes in advance. 

4. On decorating your home. Erin says that the best decorating is done slowly, so it can truly reflect your personal style. It's easy to go to a store or browse online and pick out an entire apartment's furnishings all at once, but having more patience allows us to find the perfect items for our home. I definitely fell into the, "We need everything right now!" trap when we first moved into our current apartment (we didn't have a couch or a dining table which felt like a pretty urgent void to fill). But this advice has inspired me to slow down and browse craigslist for future items that are high-quality and that tell more of a story. It takes patience but is usually worth the wait. 

5. On cleaning your home more naturally. This section of the book was fascinating to me. After sharing some scary research on the number of synthetic chemicals found in typical cleaning supplies, Erin shares a more natural approach to cleaning. Her cleaning arsenal mostly consists of different mixtures of water, baking soda, white vinegar, essential oils, and coconut oil. I'm really intrigued by her glass cleaner: Equal parts white vinegar and water combined with a few drops of citrus essential oil. There's no way that works as well as Windex, right? I'm really curious to find out. 

If you do pick up this book I will say it falls into the more extreme side of clearing out and decorating. The pictures Erin includes are beautiful, but her apartment feels pretty sparse and empty to me. She's upfront about her love for all things neutral and definitely falls into [the minimal, neutral-aesthetic side of things](https://redletterdayblog.com/4-Things-I-Dislike-About-Minimalism). Personally, I like my home to feel playful and inviting, and for me, that means lots of color. But to each their own. Overall, it was a great read. I'm feeling inspired and excited to incorporate some of these tips into my own home.
