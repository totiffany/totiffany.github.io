  tone of my last post, this new stage with Hazel is a tough one, and it's
  wearing on me. Most days I feel like I can't get anything done, and whenever I
  try to she usually yells at me demanding my full attention. It doesn't even
  have to be something productive. I can't go to the bathroom without her
  pounding at the door and loudly protesting that I come back out. She's at that
  transition where she's so close to being more independent, but still very much
  a baby. She wants to be by my side most of the day, and as much as I love her,
  it can be mind-numbing and exhausting to keep her entertained all day.

Fancy seeing you here. In a pumpkin patch in October. How very unexpected. 

I know things have been quiet on the blog this past month. I'll be honest I've been feeling a little overwhelmed lately. As you can probably tell from [the tone of my last post](https://redletterdayblog.com/Our-Trip-To-NYC-And-Traveling-With-A-Toddler), this new stage with Hazel is a tough one, and it's wearing on me. Most days I feel like I can't get anything done, and whenever I try to she usually yells at me demanding my full attention. It doesn't even have to be something productive. I can't go to the bathroom without her pounding at the door and loudly protesting that I come back out. She's at that transition where she's so close to being more independent, but still very much a baby. She wants to be by my side most of the day, and as much as I love her, it can be mind-numbing and exhausting to keep her entertained all day. 

However, over the past couple of days there have been a few moments where she's played on her own and given me a few minutes to myself. It felt like a glimpse into my future when she will actually entertain herself without needing me to watch her constantly. That's actually what I remember most from my childhood – Playing with my brother and sister all day without really knowing or caring where my mom was. That is, until we started fighting or one of us got hurt. But these are the early years, and the early years are more demanding of mom. I get that. But that doesn't make me any less tired.

Thankfully, the tough moments are mixed with Hazel being so, so cute and entertaining. She has developed a few words and whenever she says one just right I'm amazed at how bright she is. She's finally caught onto the sign language I've been teaching her, and loves to point out airplanes and stars and birds in real life and in all of her books. Sometimes I stare at her face and her head full of curls, and am so amazed by how beautiful she is that I can't believe she's real. So things are good. And most of the time she's super sweet and happy. She's just also, yunno, a toddler. 

And October really wasn't all bad. Shortly after we got back from New York my oldest friend Cassie came to visit us from Texas. I loved showing her around the city and introducing her to my favorite pastry – the kouign-amann from b. patisserie bakery. I also happened to have tickets to the musical Waitress the weekend she was in town, so we went together, and had a great time. The music was all written by Sara Barellis whom I'm a massive fan of. I laughed, I cried. It was wonderful.

Our church's Halloween party was this past weekend and we dressed up as San Francisco's favorite donut shop, Bob's Donuts. Hazel was a donut and we were Bob's employees. I wanted to do a family costume and had a stroke of inspiration when I saw a family dressed up as Krispy Kreme donuts on Pinterest. Everyone here knows Bob's, and I knew we could put a local spin on it. To pull it off we had to get the logo exactly right, but thanks to Brian's design skills and a friend's cricut machine, it ended up looking so good we had several people asking us if we actually got our aprons from Bob's. Hazel tolerated her costume long enough for us to get a few cute pictures and to go trick-or-treating at the church. 

And finally, I think the excitement for fall starts to wane a bit in November (for me anyway, I get excited for Christmas way early), but I wanted to share [a fall playlist I've been putting together here](https://open.spotify.com/user/123893304/playlist/4DPYyakc5bbzt7W6bKxPcr?si=dOnXKxeORhyQYo0vYXwQqg). We've been listening to it a lot this past month while burning my pumpkin clove scented candle, and its made everything feel extra cozy. Enjoy!
