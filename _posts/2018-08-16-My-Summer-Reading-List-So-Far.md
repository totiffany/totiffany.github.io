Do you love a good summer read as much as I do? During the summer months, I tend to lean more towards the fiction side of things. Something about a great story that pulls you in quickly aligns itself nicely to travel, beaches, and the lazy days of summer. 

I try to fit in some reading whenever Hazel is asleep, and occasionally, if she'll let me, while she's awake and playing with her toys in the living room. I figure it's a step above scrolling mindlessly on my phone, and I like to think its influenced her fascination with books. Recently she's been trying to pull the bigger books off the bookshelf that Brian and I use. I finally let her play with one of my used paperbacks the other day, and she flipped through it for 20 minutes!

I usually borrow all of the books I want to read from the library. You can save a lot of $$$ that way, and if I'm craving a re-read I'll add them to my Christmas or birthday wish lists. In fact, 3 out of the 4 books on this list came from the library! One of the best uses of our tax dollars in my opinion. Take full advantage! 

So here's what I've been reading recently if you're looking for some summer reading inspiration. (Let's be honest, this is mostly just an ode to Celeste Ng's amazing writing). 

[Everything I Never Told You](https://www.amazon.com/Everything-I-Never-Told-You/dp/0143127551). Once I started reading this book I couldn't put it down. It's a beautiful story about a Chinese American family, but it grips you like a murder-mystery (which it kind of is). It does have a rather tragic tone throughout it, but I found the characters fascinating. I had to know more about who they were and what was going to happen to them. The biggest takeaway for me in this novel is just how important communication is among family members. There were so many hopes, dreams, and assumptions made by the characters in this book that were never spoken out loud, and it has devastating consequences. 

[Little Fires Everywhere](https://www.amazon.com/Little-Fires-Everywhere-Random-House/dp/052549877X/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=&dpID=51MXTPRL13L&preST=_SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&dpSrc=detail). After reading Everything I Never Told you I was eager to read Celeste Ng's second novel. It was on hold for weeks at the library, and I was so excited when I finally got my hands on it. Well, I wasn't disappointed. I flew through this book in 2 days. The way she explores the intricacies between family relationships is just fantastic. The characters feel so real and complex. I found myself despising certain characters in one chapter only to be sympathizing with them the next. My only criticism is I do wish this novel had a more satisfying ending. It's very bittersweet, and the reader is forced to draw their own conclusions. 

[Truly Madly Guilty](https://www.amazon.com/Truly-Madly-Guilty-Liane-Moriarty/dp/1250069807/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1534482042&sr=1-1&keywords=truly+madly+guilty). This author is usually a great go-to for me when I need to get back into the habit of reading, so I decided to give this book a try. Unfortunately, I didn't like it as much as her other books ([Big Little Lies](https://www.amazon.com/Big-Little-Lies-Liane-Moriarty/dp/0425274861/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1534482075&sr=1-1&keywords=big+little+lies), [What Alice Forgot](https://www.amazon.com/What-Alice-Forgot-Liane-Moriarty/dp/0425247449/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1534482093&sr=1-1&keywords=what+alice+forgot), and [The Husband's Secret](https://www.amazon.com/Husbands-Secret-Liane-Moriarty/dp/0451490045/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1534482114&sr=1-1&keywords=the+husbands+secret), which I absolutely can recommend). I found the plot to drag a bit. The foreshadowing was a bit too obvious, and I quickly tired of the word "barbecue" and the phrases "at the barbecue" or "that was before the barbecue" and "the day of the barbecue." We get it. Something terrible happens at the barbecue. Just tell us already! 

[I Know How She Does It](https://www.amazon.com/Know-How-She-Does-Successful/dp/0143109723/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1534482145&sr=1-1). This is the book I'm currently reading and the only non-fiction book I've read so far this summer. Since quitting my job I've become really interested in working moms and how they balance work, home life, and being a mom. The author of this book was interested in the topic as well, and when she couldn't find any great research or data to pull from, she created a study herself. She had hundreds of working moms keep time logs, so she can actually break down how they are spending their time and making everything work. Her key finding? It is possible to have a successful, thriving career and still spend time with your kids, without getting burnt out.
