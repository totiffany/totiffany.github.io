Pictures coming soon! 

I love makeup, but I only use a small handful of products each day. Brian finds it rather confusing that I enjoy watching beauty blogger videos back to back, but I tend to keep things simple when it comes to my own routine.  

I think one reason I'm drawn to beauty bloggers because I never really figured out how to do my makeup when I was growing up. At that time the goal was to get your skin looking as matte as possible, and any kind of shine was quickly blotted out with lots and lots of powder.  And like so many of my peers my eyebrows were the victims of over tweezing and I failed spectacularly at attempting the trendy smoky eye. Years later – I'm still growing my eyebrows back in, and I tend to avoid eyeliner and eyeshadow altogether. 

But thanks to YouTube and the rise of online makeup tutorials I feel like I have a much better handle on things now. I'm no expert by any means, but I know what I like and have a routine I'm happy with. And unlike my teenage self, I'm all about glowy skin. You'll see this as a theme in the products I've listed below, but I love anything that gives me a nice, natural-looking shine. 

Before we dive in I did want to mention that I do a mix of high end + drugstore products. I've just found what works best for me and am willing to shell out for that. If you see something here you'd like to try but are hesitant because of the price tag, you can ask a Sephora associate to make a sample for you of any of their makeup products. I've done this for all sorts of stuff, and it's totally worth it to try out something before you make a big purchase.

Your Skin But Better CC Cream. Guys. This is one of the best foundations I have ever used. I'm seriously in love with this product. I tend to think of CC creams as more on the lighter side, but this has a great medium coverage that makes your skin look so even, luminous, and yes, glowy. Bonus – It has SPF 50 in it! I don't know of any other foundation that has an SPF that high. I use it in the shade Light. 

Glossier Stretch Concealer. On a typical day, I'll skip the foundation to let my skin breathe a bit and go straight for concealer. I tend to get dry under my eyes and I like how moisturizing this is. It's a creamy, dewy formula that goes on smoothly and never looks cakey. I wish it did a slightly better job of covering up my undereye circles, but it's great for everyday use. I use it in the shade medium. 

Tarte Cheek Stain. Blush is one of my favorite makeup products. It's such a quick and easy way to make you look fresh-faced and bright. This is a cream blush that gives you dewy, natural-looking rosy cheeks. Don't be fooled by the bright color on this one. A little goes a long way, and it blends out beautifully. I use this in the shade Natural Beauty. https://tartecosmetics.com/en_US/makeup/cheeks/blush-cheek-stain/cheek-stain/278.html?dwvar_278_color=natural%20beauty%20%28sheer%20rosy%20red%29&cgid=blush-cheekstain#start=7 

Too Faced Chocolate SoI never used to use bronzer until a few years ago, and now I can't believe I ever went without it. This one adds such a nice sunkissed look to the skin and it takes all of 2 seconds to apply. 

L'Oreal Voluminous Mascara. I've tried fancier mascara brands and for me, I just don't see the difference between those and the drugstore brands. This is my favorite. It's 

Anastasia Brow Powder + Glossier Boy Brow. I know thick eyebrows are in style right now, but I prefer a more natural look with mine, and I've found powder is the best for that. I apply it with the 

Everyday lip colors.
