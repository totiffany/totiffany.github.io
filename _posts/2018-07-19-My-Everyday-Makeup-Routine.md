Pictures coming soon! 

I love makeup, but I tend to keep things simple for my everyday routine, and only use a handful of products. Brian has mentioned to me he finds it confusing how much I enjoy watching beauty blogger videos back to back, but rarely apply the full face of makeup they do in their tutorials.  

I think one reason I think I'm drawn to beauty bloggers is I never really figured out how to do my makeup growing up. At that time the goal was to get your skin looking as matte as possible. Any kind of shine was quickly blotted out with lots and lots of powder. Like so many of my peers, my eyebrows were the victims of over tweezing, and I failed at attempting the trendy "smoky eye." 

Years later – I'm still growing my eyebrows back in, and I tend to avoid eyeliner and eyeshadow altogether. But thanks to YouTube I feel like I have a much better handle on my overall makeup routine. I'm no expert by any means, but I know what I like and have found products I'm happy with. And unlike my teenage self, I'm all about that glow. You'll see this as a theme in the products I've listed below, but I love anything that gives a nice, natural sheen to the skin. 

**[Your Skin But Better CC Cream](https://www.sephora.com/product/your-skin-but-better-cc-cream-spf-50-P411885)**. Guys. This is one of the best foundations I have ever used. I'm seriously in love with this product. I tend to think of CC creams as more on the lighter side, but this has a great medium coverage that makes your skin look so even, luminous, and yes, glowy. Bonus – It has SPF 50 in it! I don't know of any other foundation that has an SPF that high. I use it in the shade Light. 

[Glossier Stretch Concealer](https://glossier.com?g_ref=8b6dce93f5bd81). On a typical day, I'll skip the foundation to let my skin breathe a bit and go straight for concealer. I tend to get dry under my eyes and I love how moisturizing this is. It's a creamy formula that goes on smoothly and never looks cakey. I do wish it did a slightly better job of covering up my undereye circles, but it's great for everyday use. I use it in the shade medium. 

[Tarte Cheek Stain](https://tartecosmetics.com/en_US/makeup/cheeks/blush-cheek-stain/cheek-stain/278.html?dwvar_278_color=natural%20beauty%20%28sheer%20rosy%20red%29&cgid=blush-cheekstain#start=7 ). Blush is one of my favorite makeup products. It's such a quick and easy way to make look fresh-faced and bright. This is a cream blush that gives you natural-looking rosy cheeks. Don't be fooled by the bright color of the tube. It blends out beautifully, and a little goes a long way. I use this in the shade Natural Beauty. 

[Too Faced Chocolate Soleil Matte Bronzer](https://www.sephora.com/product/chocolate-soleil-medium-deep-matte-bronzer-P229406?skuId=2064442&om_mmc=ppc-GG_1165716884_53825915260_aud-299050439958:pla-418043627462_2064442_257731948316_9031944_c&country_switch=us&lang=en&gclid=CMHVmYDwrNwCFWGPxQId08cAlw&gclsrc=ds). I never used bronzer until a few years ago, and now I can't believe I ever went without it. This one adds such a nice, natural sunkissed look to the skin, and takes all of 2 seconds to apply. I use it in the shade medium/deep. 

[L'Oreal Voluminous Mascara](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BIZ0PM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B004BIZ0PM&linkCode=as2&tag=redletterda04-20&linkId=25097545d6e92bf62e3e818c99fc7081). I've tried fancier mascaras and for me, I just don't see the difference between those and the drugstore brands. This one is my favorite. It's lengthing, thickening, and doesn't clump up. What more do you need? Quick tip: I always curl my lashes with the [Surratt Eyelash Curler](https://www.sephora.com/product/relevee-lash-curler-P394163?skuId=1673482&icid2=products%20grid:p394163)before applying mascara. It works better than any other lash curler ever. Trust me on this. It's worth the price tag. 

[Anastasia Brow Powder](https://www.sephora.com/product/brow-powder-duo-P69300?skuId=929778&om_mmc=ppc-GG_1165716881_53825938700_aud-299050440478:pla-419487263469_929778_257731947962_9031944_c&country_switch=us&lang=en&gclid=CPCor-XyrNwCFaOhZQodn54Mdg&gclsrc=ds) + [Glossier Boy Brow](https://glossier.com?g_ref=8b6dce93f5bd81). I've found powder is the best product for more natural looking eyebrows. [I apply it with the Anastasia brow brush](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0149KGY3S/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0149KGY3S&linkCode=as2&tag=redletterda04-20&linkId=fddfdae1224bfdb3902005778477baea). To keep things in place I like to use the [Glossier Boy Brow](https://glossier.com?g_ref=8b6dce93f5bd81) in brown. It's their best selling product for a reason.  

Lip colors. I couldn't choose just one for this category! If I'm being honest use [Burt's Bees chapstick](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00076TOUO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00076TOUO&linkCode=as2&tag=redletterda04-20&linkId=b5df0be9276ac5ca57636f669522df89) more than anything else, but when I want a bit of color I reach for the Glossier Generation G in Cake. It's more of a tinted lip balm, so you don't have to be precise with the application, and the color is really similar to my natural lip color so it doesn't look too heavy. If I want to get a bit fancy my favorite lip color right now is the [Wet n' Wild Velvet Matte Lip Pencil in Hickory Smoked](https://www.wetnwildbeauty.com/lips/lip-color/naked-protest-velvet-matte-lip-color.html) It's the perfect rosy red. (I'm not sure why, but I can only find these at select Walgreens).

That's it! I hope this was a fun read. Do you have a makeup product you swear by? I'd love to hear them!
