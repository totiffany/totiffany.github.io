We've had a pretty solid routine with Hazel since she was around 8 months old. The key for us was getting her naps into a predictable schedule, which took us longer than I would have liked, but she's always been stubborn about naps. She used to take two of them but recently switched to one nap in the afternoon. I miss having two breaks during the day, but her being awake for a longer stretch of time allows us to get out of the apartment more. Plus now that she's only taking one nap she doesn't protest the sleep as much.

Today I'm sharing our typical everyday routine, but things are usually more flexible on the weekends. We're often out most of the day on Saturday and Sunday. Fortunately, Hazel has always been good about sleeping on the go in her car seat and stroller. I figure any amount of sleep she gets is good for her little growing body and just take it as it comes! 

**8:00pm-7:00am Hazel sleeps.**
Around 5 months we started trying to work with Hazel to sleep through the night. You can read more about that [here](https://redletterdayblog.com/Our-Closet-Nursery-+-Sleeping-Tips!). Since then, she’s been a great sleeper and typically wakes up around 7am. Once she's awake we bring her into bed with us and give her a bottle (we recently switched from formula to cow’s milk). Sometimes she’ll fall back asleep, but most of the time she won’t, and after letting her roll around in bed for a while we all get up. 

**7:30am-8:00am Breakfast.**
We put Hazel in her high chair in the kitchen to snack on a few things while one of us makes breakfast. She usually eats a banana or some other fruit and Cheerios. Mine and Brian's typical breakfast these days is peanut butter and banana toast or fried eggs. Hazel loves eggs, so we often make them for all of us. 

**8:00am-9:00am Get ready for the day.**
I feel like our day doesn’t really start until Brian leaves for work around 8:30. Before he leaves I try to get dressed (sometimes that just means sweatpants), do my makeup, and get Hazel dressed. 

**9:00am-12:00am Morning play.**
Hazel and I usually play in the living room during this time where her bookshelf and toys are. We read books, chase her ball around, play her xylophone, whatever she’s in the mood for. I’ll often walk around tidying the apartment (making the bed, doing dishes etc.), and she’ll follow me and find some random object to play with (she loves the magnets on our fridge right now). Since she dropped her morning nap this is a great time to run errands or meet up with friends with trips to the library or a playground. 

**12:00pm-12:30pm Lunch.**
I usually start lunch off with some veggies when Hazel is the hungriest. Peas are her favorite, but she’ll also eat steamed carrots or zucchini. Then we move onto fruit and some kind of protein. I'll also give her some of whatever I’m eating. Again, we eat a lot of eggs. They’re easy and filling, so I’ll often boil some for lunch if she didn't get any at breakfast. 

**1:00pm-3:00pm Naptime.**
Hazel is pretty tired by the time nap time comes around and ready to sleep. Her naptime routine is similar to her bedtime routine. I feed her a bottle, put her in a sleep sack, sing her a couple songs, and place her in her crib. She falls asleep on her own pretty quickly. I do wish she slept longer than two hours so I could have a little more time to myself, but that seems to be all she needs. While she naps I usually read a book or work on a project on my laptop. These blog posts are usually written during naptime. 

**3:00pm-6:30pm Afternoon play.**
This is similar to morning playtime. Sometimes we’ll stay home and she’ll play with her toys. I like to get out of the apartment every day, so if we didn't go anywhere in the morning we'll usually take a walk in the afternoon. Sometimes we’ll go to the grocery store to pick up a few things for dinner or head to a park. Hazel is finally old enough to enjoy playing at playgrounds, so lately that's what we've been doing in the afternoon. 

Note: Hazel is obsessed with phones right now, so when I'm around her it kind of forces me to put it away and be present with her. I'll often set my phone on top of the couch out of her reach and put on an audiobook or podcast while we play together.

**6:00pm-6:30pm Hazel’s Dinner and Brian comes home!** 
Hazel starts to get hungry again around 6, so I put her in her high chair and let her snack on a few things until Brian gets home. Once he is home he plays with Hazel while I cook dinner. 

**6:30pm-7:30pm Dinner for Brian and I.**
We call this Hazel's second dinner. Even if she ate a lot earlier she likes to eat again when we do. 

**7:30pm-8:00pm Bedtime Routine.**
Our bedtime routine is pretty straightforward. We change her into pajamas, feed her a bottle, brush her teeth as best we can, sing a few songs, give her a kiss, and place her in her crib. 

And that’s it! It's not always as rigid as this schedule makes it out to be, but this is essentially what happens. For example, on Wednesday this week we had friends over until around 1:30pm, so Hazel ate and napped later than she usually does. But we do try to stick to a routine as much as possible. I have found that having a routine that's predictable is helpful for her mood and my overall productivity during the day.
