Hello! I'm Tiffany.
</p>
<p>
I live in San Francisco with my husband Brian and our daughter Hazel. Brian and I have been married for 5 years and still like each other a lot. Hazel was born this past spring, and now our hobbies mostly consist of trying to get her to smile and laugh.
</p>
<p>  
  I've always loved to write. I like reading too and can usually recommend a good book or two.</p>
<p>
I'm originally from Idaho which will always have a special place in my heart. Idaho is affectionately known as "The Gem State" which is where the name of this blog comes from. I grew up outside hiking, camping, bike riding, and skiing. And while I wouldn't consider myself an outdoorsy type, I'm usually up for anything.
</p>
<p>
My favorite animals are pugs, and I follow several pug-themed Instagram accounts.
</p>
<p>
I'm sarcastic and cheerful and open. I tend to think the best of people.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for being here!
